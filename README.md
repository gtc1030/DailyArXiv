| **[Closed-loop control of sloshing fuel in a spinning spacecraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08121v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New-generation space missions require satellites to carry substantial amounts of liquid propellant, making it essential to analyse the coupled control-structure-propellant dynamics in detail. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers high-fidelity predictions, its computational cost limits its use in iterative design. Equivalent Mechanical Models (EMMs) provide a faster alternative, though their predictive performance, especially in closed-loop scenarios, remains largely unexplored. This work presents a comparative analysis of a spacecraft under feedback control, using both CFD and a reduced-order sloshing model. Results show good agreement, validating the simplified model for the manoeuvrer considered. This validation enables efficient sensitivity and stability studies, offering a practical tool for early-stage spacecraft design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targeted Digital Twin via Flow Map Learning and Its Application to Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07549v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin (tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing full flow simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[VICON: Vision In-Context Operator Networks for Multi-Physics Fluid Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16063v4)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) have demonstrated the ability to learn operators across diverse partial differential equations using few-shot, in-context learning. However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications. Our scripts for processing datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Eydcao/VICON.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update after NIPS suggestions</p></details> |
| **[Bioinspired Tapered-Spring Turbulence Sensor for Underwater Flow Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07348v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a bio-inspired underwater whisker sensor for robust hydrodynamic disturbance detection and efficient signal analysis based on Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC). The design uses a tapered nylon spring with embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively distinguishes vortex regimes across different fin angles and maintains Strouhal scaling with flow velocity, where higher speeds increase vibration intensity without affecting the dominant frequencies. Frequency-domain analysis, Shannon entropy, and machine learning further validated the sensing performance: vortex shedding frequencies were identified with less than 10\% error, entropy captured the transition from coherent vortex streets to turbulence, and logistic regression achieved 86.0\% classification accuracy with millisecond-level inference. These results demonstrate that structurally encoded whisker sensing provides a scalable and real-time solution for underwater perception, wake tracking, and turbulence-aware navigation in autonomous marine robots.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A comprehensive comparison of neural operators for 3D industry-scale engineering designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05995v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning nonlinear mappings between function spaces, enabling real-time prediction of complex dynamics in diverse scientific and engineering applications. With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance of a high-order MPI-Kokkos accelerated fluid solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05254v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work discusses the performance of a modern numerical scheme for fluid dynamical problems on modern high-performance computing architectures. Our code implements a spatial nodal discontinuous Galerkin scheme that we test up to an order of convergence of eight. It is temporally coupled to a set of Runge-Kutta methods of orders up to six. The code integrates the linear advection equations as well as the isothermal Euler equations in one, two, and three dimensions. In order to target modern hardware involving many-core Central Processing Units and accelerators such as Graphic Processing Units we use the Kokkos library in conjunction with the Message Passing Interface to run our single source code on various GPU systems. We find that the higher the order the faster is the code. Eighth-order simulations attain a given global error with much less computing time than third- or fourth-order simulations. The RK scheme has a smaller impact on the code performance and a classical fourth-order scheme seems to generally be a good choice. The code performs very well on all considered GPUs. The many-CPU performance is also very good and perfect weak scaling is observed up to many hundreds of CPU cores using MPI. We note that small grid-size simulations are faster on CPUs than on GPUs while GPUs win significantly over CPUs for simulations involving more than $10^7$ degrees of freedom ($\approx 3100^2$ grid points). When it comes to the environmental impact of numerical simulations we estimate that GPUs consume less energy than CPUs for large grid-size simulations but more energy on small grids. We observe a tendency that the more modern is the GPU the larger needs to be the grid in order to use it efficiently. This yields a rebound effect because larger simulations need longer computing times and in turn more energy that is not compensated by the energy efficiency gain of the newer GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 16 figures. submitted to Computer Physics Communications</p></details> |
| **[FoilDiff: A Hybrid Transformer Backbone for Diffusion-based Modelling of 2D Airfoil Flow Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04325v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate prediction of flow fields around airfoils is crucial for aerodynamic design and optimisation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Larval Zebrafish Hunting using Deep Reinforcement Learning Trained RNN Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03699v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- including eye vergence-linked pursuit, speed modulation, and stereotyped approach trajectories -- that closely match real larval zebrafish. Quantitative trajectory analyses show that pursuit bouts systematically reduce prey angle by roughly half before strike, consistent with measurements. Virtual experiments and parameter sweeps vary ecological and energetic constraints, bout kinematics (coupled vs. uncoupled turns and forward motion), and environmental factors such as food density, food speed, and vergence limits. These manipulations reveal how constraints and environments shape pursuit dynamics, strike success, and abort rates, yielding falsifiable predictions for neuroscience experiments. These sweeps identify a compact set of constraints -- binocular sensing, the coupling of forward speed and turning in bout kinematics, and modest energetic costs on locomotion and vergence -- that are sufficient for zebrafish-like hunting to emerge. Strikingly, these behaviors arise in minimal agents without detailed biomechanics, fluid dynamics, circuit realism, or imitation learning from real zebrafish data. Taken together, this work provides a normative account of zebrafish hunting as the optimal balance between energetic cost and sensory benefit, highlighting the trade-offs that structure vergence and trajectory dynamics. We establish a virtual lab that narrows the experimental search space and generates falsifiable predictions about behavior and neural coding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed Neural-operator Predictive Control for Drag Reduction in Turbulent Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03360v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing turbulence control effects for wall friction numerically is a significant challenge since it requires expensive simulations of turbulent fluid dynamics. We instead propose an efficient deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for modeling and control of turbulent flows. It is model-based RL for predictive control (PC), where both the policy and the observer models for turbulence control are learned jointly using Physics Informed Neural Operators (PINO), which are discretization invariant and can capture fine scales in turbulent flows accurately. Our PINO-PC outperforms prior model-free reinforcement learning methods in various challenging scenarios where the flows are of high Reynolds numbers and unseen, i.e., not provided during model training. We find that PINO-PC achieves a drag reduction of 39.0\% under a bulk-velocity Reynolds number of 15,000, outperforming previous fluid control methods by more than 32\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[nDNA -- the Semantic Helix of Artificial Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18216v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output? Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations. Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance, found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition. Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid dynamics: meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning, alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and, ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models, diagnose risks, and govern change over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving diverse PDE systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RheOFormer: A generative transformer model for simulation of complex fluids and flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01365v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions. Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[ROSplane 2.0: A Fixed-Wing Autopilot for Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01041v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research requires the integration of cutting-edge technology into existing autopilot frameworks. This process can be arduous, requiring extensive resources, time, and detailed knowledge of the existing system. ROSplane is a lean, open-source fixed-wing autonomy stack built by researchers for researchers. It is designed to accelerate research by providing clearly defined interfaces with an easily modifiable framework. Powered by ROS 2, ROSplane allows for rapid integration of low or high-level control, path planning, or estimation algorithms. A focus on lean, easily understood code and extensive documentation lowers the barrier to entry for researchers. Recent developments to ROSplane improve its capacity to accelerate UAV research, including the transition from ROS 1 to ROS 2, enhanced estimation and control algorithms, increased modularity, and an improved aerodynamic modeling pipeline. This aerodynamic modeling pipeline significantly reduces the effort of transitioning from simulation to real-world testing without requiring expensive system identification or computational fluid dynamics tools. ROSplane's architecture reduces the effort required to integrate new research tools and methods, expediting hardware experimentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Foam-Agent 2.0: An End-to-End Composable Multi-Agent Framework for Automating CFD Simulation in OpenFOAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18178v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation: Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline, including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent, the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3. High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency. Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems can democratize complex scientific computing.

| **[InverseBench: Benchmarking Plug-and-Play Diffusion Priors for Inverse Problems in Physical Sciences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11043v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plug-and-play diffusion priors (PnPDP) have emerged as a promising research direction for solving inverse problems. However, current studies primarily focus on natural image restoration, leaving the performance of these algorithms in scientific inverse problems largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{InverseBench}, a framework that evaluates diffusion models across five distinct scientific inverse problems. These problems present unique structural challenges that differ from existing benchmarks, arising from critical scientific applications such as optical tomography, medical imaging, black hole imaging, seismology, and fluid dynamics. With \textsc{InverseBench}, we benchmark 14 inverse problem algorithms that use plug-and-play diffusion priors against strong, domain-specific baselines, offering valuable new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms. To facilitate further research and development, we open-source the codebase, along with datasets and pre-trained models, at https://devzhk.github.io/InverseBench/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Model Verification of Wall-Bounded Flows using Finite-JAX](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25569v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed in JAX (Finite-JAX) and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations, also referred to as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features such as velocity profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition, numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for laminar regimes, allowing for the direct quantification of verification accuracy errors. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Diffuse Domain Methods with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25115v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains often presents a significant computational challenge by requiring the generation of fitted meshes. The Diffuse Domain Method (DDM) is an alternative which reformulates the problem on a larger, simple domain where the complex geometry is represented by a smooth phase-field function. This paper introduces and analyses several new DDM methods for solving problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We derive two new methods from the mixed formulation of the governing equations. This approach transforms the essential Dirichlet conditions into natural boundary conditions. Additionally, we develop coercive formulations based on Nitsche's method, and provide proofs of coercivity for all new and key existing approximations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved accuracy of the new methods, and reveal the balance between $L^2$ and $H^1$ errors. The practical effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a benchmark fluid dynamics problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Certificate of Trust: Task-Aware OOD Detection for Scientific AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25080v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/bogdanraonic3/OOD_Detection_ScientificML</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Solve Optimization Problems Constrained with Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24573v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables, and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints. This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation, heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code2MCP: Transforming Code Repositories into MCP Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05941v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) aims to create a standard for how Large Language Models use tools. However, most current research focuses on selecting tools from an existing pool. A more fundamental, yet largely overlooked, problem is how to populate this pool by converting the vast number of existing software projects into MCP-compatible services. To bridge this gap, we introduce Code2MCP, an agent-based framework that automatically transforms a GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Code2MCP employs a multi-agent workflow for code analysis, environment setup, tool function design, and service generation, enhanced by a self-correcting loop to ensure reliability. We demonstrate that Code2MCP successfully transforms open-source computing libraries in scientific fields such as bioinformatics, mathematics, and fluid dynamics that are not available in existing MCP servers. By providing a novel automated pathway to unlock GitHub, the world's largest code repository, for the MCP ecosystem, Code2MCP serves as a catalyst to significantly accelerate the protocol's adoption and practical application. The code is public at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/Code2MCP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reversible GNS for Dissipative Fluids with Consistent Bidirectional Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22207v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator (R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ChaosNexus: A Foundation Model for Universal Chaotic System Forecasting with Multi-scale Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21802v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system, they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications, which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics. ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40% compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning. Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the opposing vertical surfaces of the thin layer are in relative motion. This setup is particularly relevant to grinding processes, where cooling lubricants interact with the rough surface of a rotating grinding wheel. The resulting model is non-linearly coupled through(i) temperature-dependent viscosity and (ii) convective heat transport. The underlying geometry is highly heterogeneous due to the thin, rough surface characterized by a small parameter representing both the height of the layer and the periodicity of the roughness. We analyze this non-linear system for existence, uniqueness, and energy estimates and study the limit behavior within the framework of two-scale convergence in thin domains. In this limit, we derive an effective interface model in 3D (a line in 2D) for the heat and fluid interactions inside the fluid. We implement the system numerically and validate the limit problem through direct comparison with the micromodel. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the temperature-dependent viscosity and various geometrical configurations via simulation experiments. The corresponding numerical code is freely available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Accurate modeling requires coupling of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, especially during transient events such as depressurization. In this work, we present a unified framework for two-phase multicomponent transport in pipelines that integrates both aspects. Specifically, we employ the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) for modeling the transport of two-phase CO2-rich mixture, with thermodynamic closure provided by a Helmholtz energy-based equation of state. Phase equilibrium calculations are performed using UVN-flash, supplemented with a stability analysis procedure to detect phase separation and generate initial guesses for the phase-equilibrium calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel tailored UVN-flash routine that aligns with the fluid dynamics formulation. This is achieved by introducing an alternative and better-scaled set of variables for the phase-equilibrium calculations. The proposed framework is applied to the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing CO2-rich mixtures, demonstrating its effectiveness for CCS-relevant applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 11 figures, 4 appendicies</p></details> |

The proposed numerical model addresses some of the numerical and computational challenges that high-Reynolds-number simulations pose, facilitating the reproduction of stratified turbulent fluid dynamics typically observed in oceanic and atmospheric flows, namely the development of thin regions of high vertical shear, strongly layered turbulence at high Reynolds numbers and internal wave radiation. This Navier-Stokes solver utilizes a Fourier pseudo-spectral method in the horizontal direction and a modal spectral element discretization in the vertical. We adopt an implicit-explicit time discretization scheme that involves solving several one-dimensional Helmholtz problems at each time step. Static condensation and modal boundary-adapted basis functions result in an inexpensive algorithm based on solving many small tridiagonal systems. A series of benchmark studies is presented to demonstrate the robustness of the flow solver. These include two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, concluding with a turbulent stratified wake generated by a sphere in linear stratification.</p></details> | 41 pages, 24 figures |

Benchmarking such methods is essential for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs, respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise. MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Citrus Under Protective Screening (CUPS) exemplifies this need in digital agriculture, where citrus research facilities are instrumented with numerous sensors monitoring environmental conditions and detecting protective screening damage. CUPS demands access to computational fluid dynamics codes for modeling environmental conditions and guiding real-time interventions like water application or robotic repairs.

We propose two dimensional analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD problems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |

When the transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees that the unique optimal transport map satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation and is the gradient of a convex function. In [arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks (mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps across both image morphing tasks and high-dimensional OT problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>CAMSA...</summary><p>CAMSAP 2025 Camera-Ready Version</p></details> |
| **[A Divergence-free Preserving Mixed Finite Element Method for Thermally Driven Active Fluid Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19053v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this report, we propose a divergence-free preserving mixed finite element method (FEM) for the system of nonlinear fourth-order thermally driven active fluid equations. By introducing two auxiliary variables, we lower the complexity of the model and enhance the robustness of the algorithm. The auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$ is used to convert the original fourth-order system to an equivalent system of second-order equations, thereby easing the regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-conforming finite element space. The second variable $\eta$, analogous to the pressure, helps the scheme preserve the divergence-free condition arising from the model. The two-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator, unconditionally non-linear stable and second-order accurate under non-uniform time grids, is combined with the mixed FEM for fully discrete approximation. Due to the fine properties of the DLN scheme, we prove the boundedness of model energy and the associated error estimates under suitable regularity assumptions and mild time restrictions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on a minimum-dissipation criterion is to balance computational costs and time efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in simulating complex active fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasi Steady-State Frequency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21461v5)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, clinical imaging is either incompatible with LVADs or yields sparse, low-quality velocity data. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide high-fidelity data, they are computationally intensive and impractical for routine clinical use. To address this, we propose LVADNet3D, a 3D convolutional autoencoder that reconstructs full-resolution intraventricular velocity fields from sparse velocity vector inputs. In contrast to a standard UNet3D model, LVADNet3D incorporates hybrid downsampling and a deeper encoder-decoder architecture with increased channel capacity to better capture spatial flow patterns. To train and evaluate the models, we generate a high-resolution synthetic dataset of intraventricular blood flow in LVAD-supported hearts using CFD simulations. We also investigate the effect of conditioning the models on anatomical and physiological priors. Across various input configurations, LVADNet3D outperforms the baseline UNet3D model, yielding lower reconstruction error and higher PSNR results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 6 pages, 4 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation of numerical experiments for complex physical systems.

| **[Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method with Upper and Lower Bound Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16018v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) is a simple and effective method for reconstructing a function from its incomplete pointwise observations. However, applying DEIM to functions with physically constrained ranges can produce reconstructions with values outside the prescribed physical bounds. Such physically constrained quantities occur routinely in applications, e.g., mass density whose range is nonnegative. The DEIM reconstructions which violate these physical constraints are not usable in downstream tasks such as forecasting and control. To address this issue, we develop Constrained DEIM (C-DEIM) whose reconstructions are guaranteed to respect the physical bounds of the quantity of interest. C-DEIM enforces the bounds as soft constraints, in the form of a carefully designed penalty term, added to the underlying least squares problem. We prove that the C-DEIM reconstructions satisfy the physical constraints asymptotically, i.e., as the penalty parameter increases towards infinity. We also derive a quantitative upper bound for the observation residual of C-DEIM. Based on these theoretical results, we devise an efficient algorithm for practical implementation of C-DEIM. The efficacy of the method and the accompanying algorithm are demonstrated on several examples, including a heat transfer problem from fluid dynamics and a cellular automaton model of wildfire spread.</p></details> |  |

By making use of modern language features and the enhanced interoperability with C, there was finally a type safe and standard conforming method to call MPI from Fortran. This highly recommended use mpi_f08 language binding has since then been widely adopted among developers of modern Fortran applications. However, tool support for the F08 bindings is still lacking almost a decade later, forcing users to recede to the less safe and convenient interfaces. Full support for the F08 bindings was added to the performance measurement infrastructure Score-P by implementing MPI wrappers in Fortran. Wrappers cover the latest MPI standard version 4.1 in its entirety, matching the features of the C wrappers. By implementing the wrappers in modern Fortran, we can provide full support for MPI procedures passing attributes, info objects, or callbacks. The implementation is regularly tested under the MPICH test suite. The new F08 wrappers were already used by two fluid dynamics simulation codes -- Neko, a spectral finite-element code derived from Nek5000, and EPIC (Elliptical Parcel-In-Cell) -- to successfully generate performance measurements. In this work, we additionally present our design considerations and sketch out the implementation, discussing the challenges we faced in the process. The key component of the implementation is a code generator that produces approximately 50k lines of MPI wrapper code to be used by Score-P, relying on the Python pympistandard module to provide programmatic access to the extracted data from the MPI standard.</p></details> |  |
| **[A reduced-order derivative-informed neural operator for subsurface fluid-flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13620v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.</p></details> |  |

We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\) nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged; only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%. Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through plateaus.</p></details> |  |

A two-layer framework is proposed to safely achieve a desired ICP waveform modulation. First, a model predictive controller (MPC) with a disturbance observer is used for offset-free tracking of the system's motor position reference trajectory under safety constraints. Second, to address the unknown nonlinear dependence of ICP on the motor position, we employ a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm used for online learning of a motor position reference trajectory that yields the desired ICP modulation. The framework is experimentally validated using a test bench with a brain phantom that replicates realistic ICP dynamics in vitro. Compared to a previously employed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the MPC reduces mean and maximum motor position reference tracking errors by 83 % and 73 %, respectively. In less than 20 iterations, the BO algorithm learns a motor position reference trajectory that yields an ICP waveform with the desired mean and amplitude.</p></details> |  |

Current assessment relies on fluoroscopic angiography, providing limited 3D geometric information essential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and surgical planning. A multi-step AI pipeline was developed utilizing Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.5B parameters) for systematic, iterative processing of fluoroscopic angiograms through transformer-based neural architecture. The pipeline encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation. The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion. AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required under 15 minutes with second-level API response times. This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation. While requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for democratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily available imaging data.</p></details> |  |

Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs, vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body shape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams. Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4 +/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches primarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to rapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot with a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots. Without adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce terrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body reorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain often filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact models to understand interaction with complex terrain.</p></details> |  |

| **[Likelihood-informed Model Reduction for Bayesian Inference of Static Structural Loads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07950v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems use data to update a prior probability distribution on uncertain parameter values to a posterior distribution. Such problems arise in many structural engineering applications, but computational solution of Bayesian inverse problems is often expensive because standard solution approaches require many evaluations of the forward model mapping the parameter value to predicted observations. In many settings, this forward model is expensive because it requires the solution of a high-dimensional discretization of a partial differential equation. However, Bayesian inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure because the available data are primarily informative (relative to the prior) in a low-dimensional subspace, sometimes called the likelihood-informed subspace (LIS). This paper proposes a new projection-based model reduction method for static linear systems that exploits this low-dimensional structure in the setting where the unknown parameter is the right-hand-side forcing. The proposed method projects the governing partial differential equation onto the likelihood-informed subspace, yielding a computationally efficient reduced model that can be used to accelerate the solution of the inverse problem. Numerical experiments on two structural engineering model problems demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully exploit the intrinsic low-dimensionality of the problem, obtaining relative errors of O(10^{-10}) in the inverse problem solution with a 10x-100x lower-dimensional model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |

We introduce an efficient algorithm for solving such parameter-dependent linear systems for many values of $p$. The algorithm, which we call SubApSnap (for \emph{Sub}sampled $A(p)$ times \emph{Snap}shot), is based on combining ideas from model order reduction and randomised linear algebra: namely, taking a snapshot matrix, and solving the resulting tall-skinny least-squares problems using a subsampling-based dimension-reduction approach. We show that SubApSnap is a strict generalisation of the popular DEIM algorithm in nonlinear model order reduction. SubApSnap is a sublinear-time algorithm, and once the snapshot and subsampling are determined, it solves $A(p_*)x(p_*)=b(p_*)$ for a new value of $p_*$ at a dramatically improved speed: it does not even need to read the whole matrix $A(p_*)$ to solve the linear system for a new value of $p_*$. We prove under natural assumptions that, given a good subsampling and snapshot, SubApSnap yields solutions with small residual for all parameter values of interest. We illustrate the efficiency and performance of the algorithm with problems arising in PDEs, model reduction, and kernel ridge regression, where SubApSnap achieves speedups of many orders of magnitude over a standard solution; for example over $20,000\times$ for a $10^7\times 10^7$ problem, while providing good accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Building on prior efforts involving overlapping SAM (O-SAM), we formulate and assess two NO-SAM variants, based on alternating Dirichlet-Neumann and Robin-Robin transmission conditions. For the subdomain-local models, we consider a mix of full order models (FOMs) and non-intrusive reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via an emerging model reduction technique known as operator inference (OpInf). Of particular novelty is the first application of NO-SAM to couple non-intrusive OpInf ROMs with each other, and with FOMs. Numerical studies on a one-dimensional linear elastic wave propagation benchmark problem demonstrate that transmission condition choice and parameter tuning significantly impact convergence rate, accuracy, and stability. Robin-Robin coupling often yields faster convergence than alternating Dirichlet-Neumann, though improper parameter selection can induce spurious oscillations at subdomain interfaces. For FOM-OpInf and OpInf-OpInf couplings, sufficient modal content in the ROM basis improves accuracy and mitigates instability, in some cases outperforming the coupled FOM-FOM reference solutions in both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight NO-SAM's potential for enabling flexible, non-intrusive, and efficient multi-model coupling across independently meshed subdomains, while emphasizing the need for careful interface condition design in higher-dimensional and predictive settings.</p></details> |  |

The Oja flow is a matrix differential equation on the Stiefel manifold designed to extract a dominant subspace. While its analysis has traditionally been restricted to symmetric positive-definite matrices, where it acts as a gradient flow, recent applications have extended its use to general matrices. In this non-symmetric case, the flow extracts the invariant subspace corresponding to the eigenvalues with the largest real parts. However, prior convergence results have been purely local, leaving the global behavior as an open problem. This paper fills this gap by providing a comprehensive global convergence analysis, establishing that the flow converges exponentially for almost all initial conditions. We also propose a modification to the algorithm that enhances its numerical stability. As an application of this theory, we develop novel methods for the model reduction of linear dynamical systems and the synthesis of low-rank stabilizing controllers.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

The scheme is related to the Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for model reduction, but uses an adaptive algorithm for selection of frequency points for interrogating the system response, as would be required in identification versus model reduction. The scheme is particularly suited for systems in which any one sinusoidal response run is long or expensive, and thus there is an incentive to reduce the total number of such runs. Two key features of our algorithm are the use of transient data in sinusoidal runs to both optimize the barycentric weights, and automated next-frequency selection on an adaptive grid. Both are done with error criteria that are proxies for a system's $H^2$ and $H^\infty$ norms respectively. Furthermore, the optimization problem we formulate is convex, and can optionally guarantee stability of the identified system. Computational results on a high-order, lightly damped structural system highlights the efficacy of this scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures Submitted to IEEE American Control Conference 2026</p></details> |

However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The "space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</p></details> | 62 pages, 26 figures |

Dimensionality reduction is achieved using nonlinear maps represented by autoencoders. The resulting low-dimensional ODE is then solved using standard integration in time schemes, and the high-dimensional solution is reconstructed from the low-dimensional one. We investigate the applicability of neural networks for constructing effective autoencoders with the property of reconstructing the input manifold with null representation error. We study the convergence of the reduced-order model to the high-fidelity one. Numerical experiments show the robustness and accuracy of our approach, highlighting its potential to accelerate complex dynamical simulations without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, we examine how the reduction influences the stability properties of the reconstructed high-dimensional solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20615v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing, modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

While determining the existence of a positive reachable realization remains in general an open problem, we are able to fully characterize the cases in which the new model is obtained with non-negative reduction matrices, and hence positivity of the reduced model is robust with respect to small perturbations of the original system. The characterization is obtained by specializing monotone matrix theory to positive matrices. In addition, we provide a systematic method to construct positive reductions also when minimal ones are not available, by exploiting algebraic techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite Sample Analysis of Open-loop Subspace Identification Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16639v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subspace identification methods (SIMs) are known for their simple parameterization for MIMO systems and robust numerical properties. However, a comprehensive statistical analysis of SIMs remains an open problem. Following a three-step procedure generally used in SIMs, this work presents a finite sample analysis for open-loop SIMs. In Step 1 we begin with a parsimonious SIM. Leveraging a recent analysis of an individual ARX model, we obtain a union error bound for a Hankel-like matrix constructed from a bank of ARX models. Step 2 involves model reduction via weighted singular value decomposition (SVD), where we use robustness results for SVD to obtain error bounds on extended controllability and observability matrices, respectively. The final Step 3 focuses on deriving error bounds for system matrices, where two different realization algorithms, the MOESP type and the CVA type, are studied. Our results not only agree with classical asymptotic results, but also show how much data is needed to guarantee a desired error bound with high probability. The proposed method generalizes related finite sample analyses and applies broadly to many variants of SIMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13885v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Nonlinear flow dynamics is studied, where the dynamics is regarded as a multi-layer network. The solution at the current time step is regarded as a multi-layer network of the solution at the initial time and input parameters. As for input, we consider various sources, which include source terms (well rates), permeability fields, and initial conditions. We consider the flow dynamics, where the solution is known at some locations and the data is integrated to the flow dynamics by modifying the reduced-order model. This approach allows modifying the reduced-order formulation of the problem. Because of the small problem size, limited observed data can be handled. We consider enriching the observed data using the computational data in deep learning networks. The basis functions of the global reduced order model are selected such that the degrees of freedom represent the solution at observation points. This way, we can avoid learning basis functions, which can also be done using neural networks. We present numerical results, where we consider channelized permeability fields, where the network is constructed for various channel configurations. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a good approximation using forward feed maps based on multi-layer networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient High-Order Participation Factor Computation via Batch-Structured Tensor Contraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08968v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Participation factors (PFs) quantify the interaction between system modes and state variables, and they play a crucial role in various applications such as modal analysis, model reduction, and control design. With increasing system complexity, especially due to power electronic devices and renewable integration, the need for scalable and high-order nonlinear PF (NPF) computation has become more critical. This paper presents an efficient tensor-based method for calculating NPFs up to an arbitrary order. Traditional computation of PFs directly from normal form theory is computationally expensive -- even for second-order PFs -- and becomes infeasible for higher orders due to memory constraints. To address this, a tensor contraction-based approach is introduced that enables the calculation of high-order PFs using a batching strategy. The batch sizes are dynamically determined based on the available computational resources, allowing scalable and memory-efficient computation.</p></details> |  |

Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</p></details> |  |

The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel robustness metric for estimation of parametrized linear dynamical systems with and without control actions. For the computation of this metric, we delineate the uncertainty contributions arising from control actions, system dynamics, and initial conditions. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical findings, we establish connections between these new results and the existing literature on the robustness of model reduction. This work provides guidance for selecting estimation methods based on tolerable levels of parametric uncertainty and paves the way for new cost functions in data-driven estimation that reward sensitivity to a desired subset of parameters while penalizing others.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication in the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2025</p></details> |

| **[A locking free multiscale method for linear elasticity in stress-displacement formulation with high contrast coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18054v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving strongly symmetric stress approximations for linear elasticity problems in high-contrast media poses a significant computational challenge. Conventional methods often struggle with prohibitively high computational costs due to excessive degrees of freedom, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient multiscale model reduction method and a computationally inexpensive coarse-grid simulation technique for linear elasticity equations in highly heterogeneous, high-contrast media. We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.</p></details> |  |

Building on a high order finite element discretization of the governing equations, we develop a projection based reduced model using data driven reduced basis functions and hyperreduction via the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP). We introduce a strongly energy conservative variant of EQP that enforces exact discrete total energy conservation during the hyperreduction process. Numerical experiments for four benchmark problems -- Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, triple point and Taylor-Green vortex -- demonstrate that the numerical implementation of our proposed method conserves total energy to near machine precision while maintaining accuracy comparable to the basic EQP formulation. These results establish the energy conservative EQP (CEQP) method as an effective structure preserving hyperreduction strategy for the reduced simulation of nonlinear Lagrangian hydrodynamics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 1 figure |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |

| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> |  |

QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

Our approach combines unfitted finite element methods with both classical and tensor-based reduced basis techniques -- particularly the tensor-train reduced basis method -- to enable efficient and accurate model reduction on general geometries. To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional problems -- including Poisson, linear elasticity, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations -- demonstrate the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach is proposed to determine globally optimal interpolation points, providing an effective way to compute the reduced-order models via Krylov projection-based methods. In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability Gramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction problem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\gamma$ to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also prove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and demonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced models. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative approaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach also provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally convergent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, CDC conference</p></details> |

We first prove exponential stability and suboptimality of the continuous-time full-order model (FOM) RHC scheme in Hilbert spaces. A Galerkin model reduction is then introduced, along with a rigorous a posteriori error analysis for the associated finite-horizon optimal control problems. This results in a ROM-based RHC algorithm that adaptively constructs reduced-order controls, ensuring exponential stability of the FOM closed-loop state and providing computable performance bounds with respect to the infinite-horizon FOM control problem. Numerical experiments with a non-smooth cost functional involving the squared l1-norm confirm the methods effectiveness, even for exponentially unstable systems.</p></details> |  |

In the most widely used coupled model, fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow domain and Darcy's law in the porous medium, and complemented by the appropriate interface conditions. However, traditional coupling concepts are restricted, with a few exceptions, to one-dimensional flows parallel to the fluid-porous interface. In this work, we use an alternative approach to model interaction between the plain-fluid domain and porous medium by considering a transition zone, and propose the full- and hybrid-dimensional Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models. In the first case, the equi-dimensional Brinkman equations are considered in the transition region, and the appropriate interface conditions are set on the top and bottom of the transition zone. In the latter case, we perform a dimensional model reduction by averaging the Brinkman equations in the normal direction and using the proposed transmission conditions. The well-posedness of both coupled problems is proved, and some numerical simulations are carried out in order to validate the concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, Published in Applied Mathematics and Computation, 2025, DOI:/10.1016/j.amc.2025.129687</p></details> |

The technique of power-series decomposition is exploited: this decomposes the solution of the nonlinear PDE characterizing the center manifold into the solutions of a series of recursively defined Sylvester equations. This approach allows yielding nonlinear reduced-order models in very much the same way as in the linear case (e.g. analytically). Algorithms are proposed for obtaining the order and the parameters of the reduced-order models with precision of degree $\kappa$. The approach also provides new insights into the nonlinear moment matching problem: first, a lower bound for the order of the reduced-order model is obtained, which, in the MIMO case, can be strictly less than the number of matched moments; second, it is revealed that the lower bound is affected by the ratio of the number of the input and output channels; third, it is shown that under mild conditions, a nonlinear reduced-order model can always be constructed with either a linear state equation or a linear output equation.</p></details> |  |

The SOG-TNN utilizes a low-rank tensor product representation of the solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality associated with high-dimensional integration. To handle the Coulomb interaction, we introduce an SOG decomposition to approximate the interaction kernel such that it is dimensionally separable, leading to a tensor representation with rapid convergence. We further develop a range-splitting scheme that partitions the Gaussian terms into short-, long-, and mid-range components. They are treated with the asymptotic expansion, the low-rank Chebyshev expansion, and the model reduction with singular-value decomposition, respectively, significantly reducing the number of two-dimensional integrals in computing electron-electron interactions. The SOG decomposition well resolves the computational challenge due to the singularity of the Coulomb interaction, leading to an efficient algorithm for the high-dimensional problem under the TNN framework. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the new method, revealing that the SOG-TNN is a promising way for tackling large and complex quantum systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for High-Dimensional Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09084v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is widely used for model reduction, its standard form does not take into account any parametric model structure. Extensions to POD have been proposed to address this, but these either require large amounts of solution data, lack online adaptivity, or have limited approximation accuracy. We circumvent these limitations by instead assigning weights to the snapshot matrix columns, and updating these whenever the model is evaluated at a new point in the parameter space. We derive an a posteriori error bound that depends on these snapshot weights, show how these weights can be chosen to tighten the error bound, and present an algorithm to compute the corresponding reduced basis efficiently. We show how this weighted POD approach can be used to naturally generalize the calculation of reduced basis derivatives to situations with multidimensional parameter spaces and snapshots at multiple locations in the parameter space. Lastly, we cover how these approaches can be implemented within an optimization algorithm, without the need for an offline training phase. The proposed weighted POD methods with and without reduced basis derivatives are applied to a gradient-based shell thickness optimization problem with 105 design parameters and a time-dependent partial differential equation. The numerical solutions obtained for this problem attain errors that are several orders of magnitude smaller when using weighted POD than those computed with regular POD and Grassmann manifold interpolation, while having comparable wall times per query and requiring fewer high-dimensional model snapshots to reach an optimal solution.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |

The ROMs are learned non-intrusively from available training data of physically accurate numerical simulations. The method can be applied to general nonlinear systems through the use of polynomial model form, while not requiring knowledge of the underlying physical model, governing equations, or numerical solvers. The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method provides a flexible, non-intrusive model reduction framework, well suited for the analysis of complex spatio-temporal pattern formation phenomena.</p></details> |  |

While this opens the door to learning large-scale RENs, deploying such large-scale RENs in real-time applications on resource-limited devices remains challenging. Since a REN consists of a feedback interconnection of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics and static activation functions, this article proposes a projection-based approach to reduce the state dimension of the LTI component of a trained REN. One of the two projection matrices is dedicated to preserving contraction and robustness by leveraging the already-learned REN contraction certificate. The other projection matrix is iteratively updated to improve the accuracy of the reduced-order REN based on necessary $h_2$-optimality conditions for LTI model reduction. Numerical examples validate the approach, demonstrating significant state dimension reduction with limited accuracy loss while preserving contraction and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model reduction for fully nonlinear stochastic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02263v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernel-Based Sparse Additive Nonlinear Model Structure Detection through a Linearization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01453v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the model reduction by moment matching technique, we approximate the system with a reduced-order model. Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the approach for a benchmark model reduction problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial Floquet Transformation and Model Order Reduction of Linear Time-Periodic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00221v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-periodic dynamical systems occur commonly both in nature and as engineered systems. Large-scale linear time-periodic dynamical systems, for example, may arise through linearization of a nonlinear system about a given periodic solution (possibly as a consequence of a baseline periodic forcing) with subsequent spatial discretization. The potential need to simulate responses to a wide variety of input profiles (viewed as perturbations off a baseline periodic forcing) creates a potent incentive for effective model reduction strategies applicable to linear time-periodic (LTP) systems. Classical approaches that take into account the underlying time-periodic system structure often utilize the Floquet transform; however, computation of the Floquet transform is typically intractable for large order systems. In this paper, we develop the notion of a partial Floquet transformation connected to selected invariant subspaces of a time-varying differential operator associated with the LTP system. We modify and repurpose the Dominant Pole Algorithm of Rommes to identify effective invariant subspaces useful for model reduction. We discuss the construction of associated partial Floquet transformations and time-varying reduction bases with which to produce effective reduced-order LTP models and illustrate the process on a simple time-periodic system.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Tensor-based reduction of linear parameter-varying state-space models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23591v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) framework is a powerful tool for controlling nonlinear and complex systems, but the conversion of nonlinear models into LPV forms often results in high-dimensional and overly conservative LPV models. To be able to apply control strategies, there is often a need for model reduction in order to reduce computational needs. This paper presents the first systematic approach for the joint reduction of state order and scheduling signal dimension of LPV state space models. The existing methods typically address these reductions separately. By formulating a tensorial form of LPV models with an affine dependency on the scheduling variables, we leverage tensor decomposition to find the dominant components of state and scheduling subspaces. We extend the common Petrov-Galerkin projection approach to LPV framework by adding a scheduling projection. This extension enables the joint reduction. To find suitable subspaces for the extended Petrov-Galerkin projection, we have developed two different methods: tensor-based LPV moment matching, and an approach through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Advantages of the proposed methods are demonstrated on two different series-interconnected mass-spring-damper systems with nonlinear springs: one primarily used for comparison with other methods and a more elaborate higher-order model designed to assess scalability.</p></details> |  |

Our framework combines existing ideas from the literature and systematically addresses temporal discretization, spatial discretization, and model order reduction, ensuring that all resulting schemes are dissipation-preserving in the sense of a discrete dissipation inequality. For this, we use a Petrov-Galerkin ansatz together with appropriate projections. Numerical results for a nonlinear circuit model and the Cahn-Hilliard equation illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Operator Inference Aware Quadratic Manifolds with Isotropic Reduced Coordinates for Nonintrusive Model Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20463v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic manifolds for nonintrusive reduced modeling are typically trained to minimize the reconstruction error on snapshot data, which means that the error of models fitted to the embedded data in downstream learning steps is ignored. In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction error alone.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures.

Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Nonlinear Causal Reductions to Explain Reinforcement Learning Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14901v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do reinforcement learning (RL) policies fail or succeed? This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we generate tools and concepts for minimizing a class of energy functionals in an abstract Hilbert space setting covering a wide scope of applications such as PDEs-based inverse problems and supervised learning. The approach hinges on a Hilbert space metric in the full diffeomorphism mapping space, which could be viewed as a generalized Wasserstein-2 metric. We then study a projection gradient descent method within deep neural network parameterized sets. More importantly, we develop an adaptation and expanding strategy to step-by-step enlarge the deep neural network structures. In particular, the expansion mechanism aims to enhance the alignment of the neural manifold induced natural gradient direction as well as possible with the ideal Hilbert space gradient descent direction leveraging the fact that we can evaluate projections of the Hilbert space gradient. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy for several simple model problems for energies arising in the context of supervised learning, model reduction, or inverse problems. In particular, we highlight the importance of assembling the neural flow matrix based on the inner product for the ambient Hilbert space. The actual algorithms are the simplest specifications of a broader spectrum based on a correspondingly wider discussion, postponing a detailed analysis to forthcoming work.</p></details> | 40 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advection-dominated problems are predominantly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and various industrial processes. Traditional linear compression methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reduced basis (RB) methods are ill-suited for these problems, due to slow Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. This results in inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models (ROMs). There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural network shift augmented transformation technique that employs automatic shift detection. This approach leverages a deep-learning framework to derive a parameter-dependent mapping between the original manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. We apply a linear compression method to obtain a low-dimensional linear approximation subspace of the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. Furthermore, we construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear approximation subspace and employ automatic shift detection for predictions in the online stage. We propose a complete framework, the neural network shift-augmented proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced order model (NNsPOD-ROM) algorithm, comprising both offline and online stages for model reduction of advection-dominated problems. We test our proposed methodology on numerous experiments to evaluate its performance on the 1D linear advection equation, a higher order method benchmark case - the 2D isentropic convective vortex, and 2D two-phase flow.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 Figures |

The procedure is based on a generalized interpolation framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and was coined PDE-$\beta$-greedy procedure, where the parameter $\beta \geq 0$ is used in a greedy selection criterion and steers the degree of function adaptivity. Algebraic convergence rates have been obtained for Sobolev-space kernels and solutions of finite smoothness. We now report a result of exponential convergence rates for the case of infinitely smooth kernels and solutions. We furthermore extend the approximation scheme to the case of parametric PDEs by the use of state-parameter product kernels. In the surrogate modelling context, the resulting approach can be interpreted as an a priori model reduction approach, as no solution snapshots need to be precomputed. Numerical results show the efficiency of the approximation procedure for problems which occur as challenges for other parametric MOR procedures: non-affine geometry parametrizations, moving sources or high-dimensional domains.</p></details> |  |

In this work we present a construction for Controllability and Observability Gramians in a class of non-affine control input systems satisfying certain induced norm properties. We do so using a combination of representational forms, including a novel function decomposition that resembles linear Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), in tandem with an additional unconventional decomposition of the dynamics, and Koopman operator theory.

| **[An ensemble Kalman approach to randomized maximum likelihood estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03207v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes ensemble Kalman randomized maximum likelihood estimation, a new derivative-free method for performing randomized maximum likelihood estimation, which is a method that can be used to generate approximate samples from posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems. The new method has connections to ensemble Kalman inversion and works by evolving an ensemble so that each ensemble member solves an instance of a randomly perturbed optimization problem. Linear analysis demonstrates that ensemble members converge exponentially fast to randomized maximum likelihood estimators and, furthermore, that the new method produces samples from the Bayesian posterior when applied to a suitably regularized optimization problem. The method requires that the forward operator, relating the unknown parameter to the data, be evaluated once per iteration per ensemble member, which can be prohibitively expensive when the forward model requires the evolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system. We propose a strategy for making the proposed method tractable in this setting based on a balanced truncation model reduction method tailored to the Bayesian smoothing problem. Theoretical results show near-optimality of this model reduction approach via convergence to an optimal approximation of the posterior covariance as a low-rank update to the prior covariance. Numerical experiments verify theoretical results and illustrate computational acceleration through model reduction.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.02273</p></details> |
| **[Dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23892v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inverse problems use observed data to update a prior probability distribution for an unknown state or parameter of a scientific system to a posterior distribution conditioned on the data. In many applications, the unknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior expensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to evaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown parameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches exploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace informed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently. Further computational cost reductions can be achieved by replacing expensive high-dimensional forward models with cheaper lower-dimensional reduced models. In this work, we propose new dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances, which arise in many practical inference settings. The dimension reduction approach is applicable to general linear Bayesian inverse problems whereas the model reduction approaches are specific to the problem of inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system. We provide theoretical approximation guarantees as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approaches.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: minor improvements</p></details> |
| **[A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20007v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to both dry-bed and wet-bed problem setups, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Reduction of Homogeneous Polynomial Dynamical Systems via Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19165v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction plays a critical role in system control, with established methods such as balanced truncation widely used for linear systems. However, extending these methods to nonlinear settings, particularly polynomial dynamical systems that are often used to model higher-order interactions in physics, biology, and ecology, remains a significant challenge. In this article, we develop a novel model reduction method for homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs) with linear input and output grounded in tensor decomposition. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of HPDSs, we construct reduced models by extracting dominant mode subspaces via higher-order singular value decomposition. Notably, we establish that key system-theoretic properties, including stability, controllability, and observability, are preserved in the reduced model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using numerical examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum volume coordinates for Grassmann interpolation: Lagrange, Hermite, and errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01574v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to Riemannian interpolation on the Grassmann manifold. Instead of relying on the Riemannian normal coordinates, i.e. the Riemannian exponential and logarithm maps, we approach the interpolation problem with an alternative set of local coordinates and corresponding parameterizations. A special property of these coordinates is that their calculation does not require any matrix decompositions. This is a numerical advantage over Riemann normal coordinates and many other retractions on the Grassmann manifold, especially when derivative data are to be treated. To estimate the interpolation error, we examine the conditioning of these mappings and state explicit bounds. It turns out that the parameterizations are well-conditioned, but the coordinate mappings are generally not. As a remedy, we introduce maximum-volume coordinates that are based on a search for subblocks of column-orthogonal matrices of large absolute determinant. We show that the order of magnitude of the asymptotic interpolation error on $\Gr(n,p)$ is the same as in the Euclidean space. Two numerical experiments are conducted. The first is an academic one, where we interpolate a parametric orthogonal projector $QQ^T$, where the $Q$--factor stems from a parametric compact QR--decomposition. The second experiment is in the context of parametric model reduction of dynamical systems, where we interpolate reduced subspaces that are obtained by proper orthogonal decomposition.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

The definition of the parametric moment is introduced, and methods (model-based and data-driven) for the approximation of the parametric moment of linear and nonlinear parametric systems are proposed. These approximations are exploited to construct families of parametric reduced-order models that match the approximate parametric moment of the system to be reduced and preserve key system properties such as asymptotic stability and dissipativity. The use of the model reduction methods is illustrated by means of a parametric benchmark model for the linear case and a large-scale wind farm model for the nonlinear case. In the illustration, a comparison of the proposed approximation methods is drawn and their advantages/disadvantages are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

We first employ the discrete form of a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) for model reduction and prove that the method exhibits exponential convergence with respect to the number of local degrees of freedom. The proposed method and its convergence analysis are applicable in broad settings, including general heterogeneous ($L^{\infty}$) coefficients, domains and subdomains with nontrivial topology, irregular subdomain geometries, and high-order finite element discretizations. Furthermore, we formulate the method as an iterative solver, yielding a two-level restricted additive Schwarz type preconditioner based on the MS-GFEM coarse space. The GMRES algorithm, applied to the preconditioned system, is shown to converge at a rate of at least $\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the error bound of the discrete MS-GFEM approximation. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in terms of dimensionality reduction.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a model reduction approach for transport-dominated problems by employing cross-correlation based snapshot registration to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay, thereby enabling the construction of efficient and accurate reduced-order models using linear approximation methods. We propose a complete framework comprising offline-online stages for the development of reduced order models using the cross-correlation based snapshots registration. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using two test cases: 1D travelling waves and the higher-order methods benchmark test case, 2D isentropic convective vortex.</p></details> |  |

Our scheme is related to the recently-developed Adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA) algorithm, which is an iterative algorithm that uses concepts from the Loewner framework. Our algorithm uses low-rank interpolation and iteratively adds interpolation points based on several criteria including minimizing maximum errors. We show there is freedom in the interpolation point selection method, leading to multiple algorithms that have trade-offs between computational complexity and approximation performance. We prove that a weighted \(H_2\) norm of a representative error system is monotonically decreasing as interpolation points are added. Finally, we provide computational results and some comparisons with prior works, demonstrating performance on par with standard model reduction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures Submitted to IEEE TAC</p></details> |

Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 4 figures, 2 tables; 25 pages supplementary material, 8 figures</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel two-stage structure identification algorithm that leverages system zero-order moments, a concept traditionally used in model order reduction, to bridge system identification and model reduction. First, zero-order moments are estimated from steady-state time-domain outputs; second, subsystem interconnections are explicitly reconstructed from these moments. The method generalizes existing approaches by handling asynchronous, non-uniform, and slow sampling simultaneously, eliminating constraints on input signal periodicity and extending applicability to multi-input multi-output NDS with arbitrary interconnections. Unlike black-box identification techniques, our approach explicitly recovers subsystem interconnection structures. Validation on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in recovering subsystem interconnections from irregular sampling data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, cdc2025</p></details> |

The EGPT-PINN extends the traditional physics-informed neural networks and its recently proposed generative pre-trained strategy for linear model reduction to nonlinear model reduction and shock-capturing domains. By utilizing an adaptive meta-network, a simultaneously trained transform layer, entropy enhancement strategies, implementable shock interaction analysis, and a separable training process, the EGPT-PINN efficiently captures complex parameter-dependent shock formations and interactions. Numerical results of EGPT-PINN applied to the families of inviscid Burgers' equation and the Euler equations, parameterized by their initial conditions, demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed technique. It accurately solves the viscosity solution via very few neurons without leveraging any {\it a priori} knowledge of the equations or its initial condition. Moreover, via a simple augmentation of the loss function by model-data mismatch, we demonstrate the robustness of EGPT-PINN in solving inverse problems more accurately than the vanilla and entropy-enhanced versions of PINN.</p></details> | 24 pages,12 figures |

However, excessive latent states and interactions from mechanistic models can lead to training inefficiency and over-fitting, limiting practical effectiveness of hybrid neural ODEs. In response, we propose a new hybrid pipeline for automatic state selection and structure optimization in mechanistic neural ODEs, combining domain-informed graph modifications with data-driven regularization to sparsify the model for improving predictive performance and stability while retaining mechanistic plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show improved predictive performance and robustness with desired sparsity, establishing an effective solution for hybrid model reduction in healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Neural empirical interpolation method for nonlinear model reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03562v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the neural empirical interpolation method (NEIM), a neural network-based alternative to the discrete empirical interpolation method for reducing the time complexity of computing the nonlinear term in a reduced order model (ROM) for a parameterized nonlinear partial differential equation. NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some "optimal" coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.

| **[Application of a Novel Model Reduction Technique to the Assessment of Boundedness/Stability of Some Delay Time-Varying Vector Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11398v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the boundedness and stability of vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients remains a challenging problem with broad applications in science and engineering. Existing methods tend to produce overly conservative criteria that offer limited practical value and often fail to explicitly characterize the temporal evolution of solution norms. This paper presents a novel framework for evaluating the evolution of solution norms in such systems. This approach constructs scalar counterparts for the original vector equations. We prove that the solutions to these scalar nonlinear equations, which also include delays and variable coefficients, provide upper bounds for the norms of the original solutions, if the history functions for both equations are properly matched. This reduction enables the evaluation of the boundedness and stability of vector systems through the analysis of the dynamics of their scalar counterparts, which can be performed via straightforward simulations or simplified analytical reasoning. Consequently, we introduce new criteria for boundedness and stability and estimate the radii of the balls containing history functions that yield bounded or stable solutions for the original vector systems. Finally, we validated our inferences through representative simulations that also assessed the accuracy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Our major contributions are threefold. First, we derive interpolation-based first-order optimality conditions for the linear quadratic-output $\mathcal{H}_2$ minimization problem. These conditions correspond to the mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation of the full-order linear- and quadratic-output transfer functions, and generalize the Meier-Luenberger optimality framework for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear time-invariant systems. Second, given the interpolation data, we show how to enforce these mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation conditions explicitly by Petrov-Galerkin projection of the full-order model matrices. Third, to find the optimal interpolation data, we build on this projection framework and propose a generalization of the iterative rational Krylov algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems, called LQO-IRKA. Upon convergence, LQO-IRKA produces a reduced linear quadratic-output system that satisfies the interpolatory optimality conditions. The method only requires solving shifted linear systems and matrix-vector products, thus making it suitable for large-scale problems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</p></details> |  |

Although topology optimization holds great potential for tuning these nonlinear dynamic responses, its use in high-dimensional systems is limited by the high cost of repeated response and sensitivity analyses. To address this challenge, we employ the spectral submanifolds (SSMs) reduction theory, which reformulates the periodic response as the equilibria of an associated reduced-order model (ROM). This enables efficient and analytic evaluation of both response amplitudes and their sensitivities. Based on the SSM-based ROM, we formulate optimization problems that optimize the peak amplitude, the hardening/softening behavior, and the distance between two saddle-node bifurcations for an FRC. The proposed method is applied to the design of nonlinear MEMS devices, achieving targeted performance optimization. This framework provides a practical and efficient strategy for incorporating nonlinear dynamic effects into the topology optimization of structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures.

This property, compounded by modeling uncertainties and disturbances, complicates the control design process for trajectory tracking. In this work, we propose an adaptive control architecture for uncertain, nonlinear, underactuated systems with input constraints. Leveraging time-scale separation, we construct a reduced-order model where fast dynamics provide virtual inputs to the slower subsystem and use dynamic control allocation to select the optimal control inputs given the non-affine dynamics. To handle uncertainty, we introduce a state predictor-based adaptive law, and through singular perturbation theory and Lyapunov analysis, we prove stability and bounded tracking of reference trajectories. The proposed method is validated on a VTOL quadplane with nonlinear, state-dependent actuation, demonstrating its utility as a unified controller across various flight regimes, including cruise, landing transition, and hover.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code https://github.com/dcherenson/adaptive-control-underactuated</p></details> |

A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However, they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent heat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D, (ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent 3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, we investigate how machine learning can be employed to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model, both at the Full Order Model (FOM) and Reduced Order Model (ROM) levels. We explore a novel integration of these two areas. We generate the FOM snapshots, essential for ROM construction, using a data-driven RANS model: the $\nu_t$-Vector Basis Neural Network. This is the first time that these machine learning procedure generalizes a large parametric variation, and we propose tailored training strategies to increase the accuracy of the FOM model. At the ROM level, we compare the results obtained by standard Proper Orthogonal Decomposition in an intrusive Galerkin setting (PODG) and POD Neural Network approach (PODNN). The numerical validation is based on a classic turbulent flow benchmark: the flow in a square duct. Our investigation reveals that the PODG method, proves unstable and inaccurate for turbulent flow prediction, while PODNN demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing forced responses and causal mechanisms in large-scale climate dynamics with reduced-order neural models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture not only stationary statistics but also responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators seek to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. Response theory offers a rigorous framework to explore these limitations, moving beyond stationary statistics, probing causal mechanisms, and guiding model design. Using a simplified multiscale system, we argue that the skill of purely data-driven models in reproducing perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying the proper variables to model, including spatial and temporal scales, and (ii) accurate stochastic parameterizations of unresolved processes. For studies of low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights motivate reduced-order neural models, tailored to specific processes, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We illustrate this perspective with a reduced-order neural stochastic model designed to investigate responses of radiative fluxes to surface temperature perturbations. The model largely reproduces stationary statistics and enables the study of forced responses in both ensemble mean and variance, shifting the study of climate feedbacks from single trajectories to responses of probability distributions. These results underscore reduced-order models, augmented with modern neural networks and evaluated within the framework of response theory, as a practical strategy for causal inference and attribution studies in large-scale climate dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |

Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip limits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an eight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg provides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke double rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far richer gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored space. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under the right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that TARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple previously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search is likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and reinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures.

| **[From Shadow to Light: Toward Safe and Efficient Policy Learning Across MPC, DeePC, RL, and LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04076v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges in modern control applications, particularly in robot and vehicle motion control, is achieving accurate, fast, and safe movement. To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to enforce safety while ensuring high performance. Since basic first-principles models of real systems are often available, model-based controllers are widely used. Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes performance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining accurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven alternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on hand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal policies directly from interaction data. Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe policies from raw input-output data. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have also emerged, translating natural language instructions into structured formulations of optimal control problems. Despite these advances, data-driven policies face significant limitations. They often suffer from slow response times, high computational demands, and large memory needs, making them less practical for real-world systems with fast dynamics, limited onboard computing, or strict memory constraints. To address this, various technique, such as reduced-order modeling, function-approximated policy learning, and convex relaxations, have been proposed to reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we present eight such approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness across real-world applications, including robotic arms, soft robots, and vehicle motion control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential decoder training for improved latent space dynamics identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03535v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations are essential in many scientific fields but often require computationally expensive solvers, motivating reduced-order models (ROMs). Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) is a data-driven ROM framework that combines autoencoders with equation discovery to learn interpretable latent dynamics. However, enforcing latent dynamics during training can compromise reconstruction accuracy of the model for simulation data. We introduce multi-stage LaSDI (mLaSDI), a framework that improves reconstruction and prediction accuracy by sequentially learning additional decoders to correct residual errors from previous stages. Applied to the 1D-1V Vlasov equation, mLaSDI consistently outperforms standard LaSDI, achieving lower prediction errors and reduced training time across a wide range of architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGRDN-Data learned sparsification of graph reaction-diffusion networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11943v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph sparsification is an area of interest in computer science and applied mathematics. Sparsification of a graph, in general, aims to reduce the number of edges in the network while preserving specific properties of the graph, like cuts and subgraph counts. Computing the sparsest cuts of a graph is known to be NP-hard, and sparsification routines exist for generating linear-sized sparsifiers in almost quadratic running time $O(n^{2 + \epsilon})$. Consequently, obtaining a sparsifier can be a computationally demanding task, and the complexity varies based on the level of sparsity required. We propose SGRDN to extend sparsification to complex reaction-diffusion systems. This approach seeks to sparsify the graph such that the inherent reaction-diffusion dynamics are strictly preserved on the resulting structure. By selectively considering a subset of trajectories, we frame the network sparsification issue as a data assimilation problem within a Reduced Order Model (ROM) space, imposing constraints to conserve the eigenmodes of the Laplacian matrix ($L = D - A$), the difference between the degree matrix ($D$) and the adjacency matrix ($A$) despite perturbations. We derive computationally efficient eigenvalue and eigenvector approximations for perturbed Laplacian matrices and integrate these as spectral preservation constraints in the optimization problem. To further validate the method's broad applicability, we conducted an additional experiment on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (neural ODEs), where SGRDN successfully achieved parameter sparsity.</p></details> |  |
| **[oRANS: Online optimisation of RANS machine learning models with embedded DNS data generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02982v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated promise for accelerating and enhancing the accuracy of flow physics simulations, but progress is constrained by the scarcity of high-fidelity training data, which is costly to generate and inherently limited to a small set of flow conditions. Consequently, closures trained in the conventional offline paradigm tend to overfit and fail to generalise to new regimes. We introduce an online optimisation framework for DL-based Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) closures which seeks to address the challenge of limited high-fidelity datasets. Training data is dynamically generated by embedding a direct numerical simulation (DNS) within a subdomain of the RANS domain. The RANS solution supplies boundary conditions to the DNS, while the DNS provides mean velocity and turbulence statistics that are used to update a DL closure model during the simulation. This feedback loop enables the closure to adapt to the embedded DNS target flow, avoiding reliance on precomputed datasets and improving out-of-distribution performance. The approach is demonstrated for the stochastically forced Burgers equation and for turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=180$, $270$, $395$ and $590$ with varying embedded domain lengths $1\leq L_0/L\leq 8$. Online-optimised RANS models significantly outperform both offline-trained and literature-calibrated closures, with accurate training achieved using modest DNS subdomains. Performance degrades primarily when boundary-condition contamination dominates or when domains are too short to capture low-wavenumber modes. This framework provides a scalable route to physics-informed machine learning closures, enabling data-adaptive reduced-order models that generalise across flow regimes without requiring large precomputed training datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transmission Conditions for the Non-Overlapping Schwarz Coupling of Full Order and Operator Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12228v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates transmission conditions for the domain decomposition-based coupling of subdomain-local models using the non-overlapping Schwarz alternating method (NO-SAM). Building on prior efforts involving overlapping SAM (O-SAM), we formulate and assess two NO-SAM variants, based on alternating Dirichlet-Neumann and Robin-Robin transmission conditions. For the subdomain-local models, we consider a mix of full order models (FOMs) and non-intrusive reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via an emerging model reduction technique known as operator inference (OpInf). Of particular novelty is the first application of NO-SAM to couple non-intrusive OpInf ROMs with each other, and with FOMs. Numerical studies on a one-dimensional linear elastic wave propagation benchmark problem demonstrate that transmission condition choice and parameter tuning significantly impact convergence rate, accuracy, and stability. Robin-Robin coupling often yields faster convergence than alternating Dirichlet-Neumann, though improper parameter selection can induce spurious oscillations at subdomain interfaces. For FOM-OpInf and OpInf-OpInf couplings, sufficient modal content in the ROM basis improves accuracy and mitigates instability, in some cases outperforming the coupled FOM-FOM reference solutions in both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight NO-SAM's potential for enabling flexible, non-intrusive, and efficient multi-model coupling across independently meshed subdomains, while emphasizing the need for careful interface condition design in higher-dimensional and predictive settings.</p></details> |  |

We leverage Physics-Informed Symbolic Regression (PISR) to discover closed-form expressions for the vector potential and number density profiles, governed by a reduced-order model derived from Maxwell-fluid equations. The PISR framework combines symbolic regression with physics-based constraints, boundary conditions, and available simulation data to guide the search for solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by rediscovering approximate solutions consistent with previously published numerical results, showcasing the potential of PISR for reducing simulation costs of reduced-order models in plasma physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 7 sections, 53 referenced works</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Fidelity Control Variate Approach for Policy Gradient Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are impractical for deployment in operational systems or for training with computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations, as they require large amounts of data. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators -- such as reduced-order models, heuristic rewards, or generative world models -- can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for zero-shot transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a control variate formed from a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to construct an unbiased, variance-reduced estimator for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework with a multi-fidelity variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm. We show that under standard assumptions, the MFPG estimator guarantees asymptotic convergence of REINFORCE to locally optimal policies in the target environment, and achieves faster finite-sample convergence rates compared to training with high-fidelity data alone. Empirically, we evaluate the MFPG algorithm across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark tasks with limited high-fidelity data but abundant off-dynamics, low-fidelity data. With mild-moderate dynamics gaps, MFPG reliably improves the median performance over a high-fidelity-only baseline, matching the performance of leading multi-fidelity baselines despite its simplicity and minimal tuning overhead. Under large dynamics gaps, MFPG demonstrates the strongest robustness among the evaluated multi-fidelity approaches. An additional experiment shows that MFPG can remain effective even under low-fidelity reward misspecification. Thus, MFPG not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Critical Control via Recurrent Tracking Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01147v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing safety-critical controllers for high-order nonlinear systems, where constructing valid Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) remains computationally intractable. Leveraging layered control, we design CBFs in reduced-order models (RoMs) while regulating full-order models' (FoMs) dynamics at the same time. Traditional Lyapunov tracking functions are required to decrease monotonically, but systematic synthesis methods for such functions exist only for fully-actuated systems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Recurrent Tracking Functions (RTFs), which replace the monotonic decay requirement with a weaker finite-time recurrence condition. This relaxation permits transient deviations of tracking errors while ensuring safety. By augmenting CBFs for RoMs with RTFs, we construct recurrent CBFs (RCBFs) whose zero-superlevel set is control $\tau$-recurrent, and guarantee safety for all initial states in such a set when RTFs are satisfied. We establish theoretical safety guarantees and validate the approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating RTFs' effectiveness and the safety of FoMs.</p></details> | 7 Pages, 2 Figures |
| **[Deep Learning for Subspace Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23249v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression, introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and solution of parametric partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. \texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.

In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

| **[Near-optimal Rank Adaptive Inference of High Dimensional Matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08117v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of estimating a high-dimensional matrix from linear measurements, with a focus on designing optimal rank-adaptive algorithms. These algorithms infer the matrix by estimating its singular values and the corresponding singular vectors up to an effective rank, adaptively determined based on the data. We establish instance-specific lower bounds for the sample complexity of such algorithms, uncovering fundamental trade-offs in selecting the effective rank: balancing the precision of estimating a subset of singular values against the approximation cost incurred for the remaining ones. Our analysis identifies how the optimal effective rank depends on the matrix being estimated, the sample size, and the noise level. We propose an algorithm that combines a Least-Squares estimator with a universal singular value thresholding procedure. We provide finite-sample error bounds for this algorithm and demonstrate that its performance nearly matches the derived fundamental limits. Our results rely on an enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on singular value thresholding. We validate our findings with applications to multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[LDMD with Temporally Adaptive Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08065v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a widely used data-driven algorithm for predicting the future states of dynamical systems. However, its standard formulation often struggles with poor long-term predictive accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a localized DMD (LDMD) framework that improves prediction performance by integrating DMD's strong linear forecasting capabilities with time-domain segmentation techniques. In this framework, the temporal domain is segmented into multiple subintervals, within which snapshot matrices are constructed and localized predictions are performed. We first present the localized DMD method with predefined segmentation, and then explore an adaptive segmentation strategy to further enhance computational efficiency and prediction robustness. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis that provides the upper bound of the local and global truncation error for the proposed framework. The effectiveness of LDMD is demonstrated on four benchmark problems-Burgers', Allen-Cahn, nonlinear Schrodinger, and Maxwell's equations. Numerical results show that LDMD significantly enhances long-term predictive accuracy while preserving high computational efficiency.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Unlike in the traditional linear setting, where direct effects are typically easier to identify and estimate, non-parametric direct effects, which are crucial for handling real-world complexities, particularly in epidemiological contexts where relationships between variables (e.g, genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors) are often non-linear, are much harder to define and identify. In particular, we give sufficient conditions for identifying average controlled micro direct effect and average natural micro direct effect from summary causal graphs in the presence of hidden confounding. Furthermore, we show that the conditions given for the average controlled micro direct effect become also necessary in the setting where there is no hidden confounding and where we are only interested in identifiability by adjustment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Curious Case of In-Training Compression of State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02823v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis, provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs \emph{during training}, where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our approach, \textsc{CompreSSM}, applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units, but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity, with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher performance.

| **[Targeted Digital Twin via Flow Map Learning and Its Application to Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07549v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin (tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing full flow simulations.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.</p></details> | 62 pages |

Our central result shows that any computable function can be simulated by the flow on a smooth bordism of a vector field with good local properties, setting an alternative model of computation to Turing machines. We thus establish that a computable function can be fully realized within a single go of a dynamical system, differing from previous works where computation is encoded as an iterative process. The output of the computable function emerges directly, laying the groundwork for potential applications that accelerate the physical realization of computation.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |

Conditional local independence, which describes whether the evolution of one process is influenced by another process given additional processes, is important for causal learning in such systems. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis test for conditional local independence in It\^o processes. Our test is grounded in the semimartingale decomposition of the It\^o process, with which we introduce a stochastic integral process that is a martingale under the null hypothesis. We then apply a test for the martingale property, quantifying potential deviation from local independence. The test statistics is estimated using the optimal filtering equation. We show the consistency of the estimation, thereby establishing the level and power of our test. Numerical verification and a real-world application to causal discovery in brain resting-state fMRIs are conducted.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Sparse dynamic network reconstruction through L1-regularization of a Lyapunov equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05457v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important problem in many areas of science is that of recovering interaction networks from simultaneous time-series of many interacting dynamical processes. A common approach is to use the elements of the correlation matrix or its inverse as proxies of the interaction strengths, but the reconstructed networks are necessarily undirected. Transfer entropy methods have been proposed to reconstruct directed networks but the reconstructed network lacks information about interaction strengths. We propose a network reconstruction method that inherits the best of the two approaches by reconstructing a directed weighted network from noisy data under the assumption that the network is sparse and the dynamics are governed by a linear (or weakly-nonlinear) stochastic dynamical system. The two steps of our method are i) constructing an (infinite) family of candidate networks by solving the covariance matrix Lyapunov equation for the state matrix and ii) using L1-regularization to select a sparse solution. We further show how to use prior information on the (non)existence of a few directed edges to drastically improve the quality of the reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Physics-Informed Learning for Stochastic Safety-Critical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08868v5)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of long-term risk is essential for the design and analysis of stochastic dynamical systems. Existing risk quantification methods typically rely on extensive datasets involving risk events observed over extended time horizons, which can be prohibitively expensive to acquire. Motivated by this gap, we propose an efficient method for learning long-term risk probabilities using short-term samples with limited occurrence of risk events. Specifically, we establish that four distinct classes of long-term risk probabilities are characterized by specific partial differential equations (PDEs). Using this characterization, we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that combines empirical data with physics information to infer risk probabilities. We then analyze the theoretical properties of this framework in terms of generalization and convergence. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our framework not only generalizes effectively beyond the sampled states and time horizons but also offers additional benefits such as improved sample efficiency, rapid online inference capabilities under changing system dynamics, and stable computation of probability gradients. These results highlight how embedding PDE constraints, which contain explicit gradient terms and inform how risk probabilities depend on state, time horizon, and system parameters, improves interpolation and generalization between/beyond the available data.</p></details> |  |

Exploiting multiscale self-organization in neuroscience and artificial intelligence requires a computational framework for modeling the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of stochastic neural trajectories. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and representational geometry offer theoretical foundations, but we need scalable data-driven techniques for modeling collective properties of high-dimensional neural networks from partial subsampled observations. Renormalization is a coarse-graining technique central to studying emergent scaling properties of many-body and nonlinear dynamical systems. While widely applied in physics and machine learning, coarse-graining complex dynamical networks remains unsolved, affecting many computational sciences. Recent diffusion-based renormalization, inspired by quantum statistical mechanics, coarse-grains networks near entropy transitions marked by maximal changes in specific heat or information transmission. Here I explore diffusion-based renormalization of neural systems by generating symmetry-breaking representations across scales and offering scalable algorithms using tensor networks. Diffusion-guided renormalization bridges microscale and mesoscale dynamics of dissipative neural systems. For microscales, I developed a scalable graph inference algorithm for discovering community structure from subsampled neural activity. Using community-based node orderings, diffusion-guided renormalization generates renormalization group flow through metagraphs and joint probability functions.

In these settings, interventions affect both current and future system states, so estimating the global average treatment effect (GATE) requires accounting for temporal dynamics, which is especially challenging in the presence of nonstationarity; existing approaches suffer from high bias, high variance, or both. In this paper, we address this challenge via the novel Truncated Policy Gradient (TPG) estimator, which replaces instantaneous outcomes with short-horizon outcome trajectories. The estimator admits a policy-gradient interpretation: it is a truncation of the first-order approximation to the GATE, yielding provable reductions in bias and variance in nonstationary Markovian settings. We further establish a central limit theorem for the TPG estimator and develop a consistent variance estimator that remains valid under nonstationarity with single-trajectory data. We validate our theory with two real-world case studies. The results show that a well-calibrated TPG estimator attains low bias and variance in practical nonstationary settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems (MoLDS) via Hybrid Tensor-EM Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06091v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories. However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings, limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data, and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these applications.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Specifically, we show that the resolvent of the Koopman operator provides a natural abstraction of halting, yielding a ``Koopman halting problem that is recursively enumerable in general. For symbolic systems, such as those defined on Cantor space, this operator formulation captures the reachability between clopen sets, while for equicontinuous systems we prove that the Koopman halting problem is decidable. Our framework demonstrates that absorbing (halting) states {in finite automata} correspond to Koopman eigenfunctions with eigenvalue one, while cycles in the transition graph impose algebraic constraints on spectral properties. These results provide a unifying perspective on computation in symbolic and analog systems, showing how computational universality is reflected in operator spectra, invariant subspaces, and algebraic structures. Beyond symbolic dynamics, this operator-theoretic lens opens pathways to analyze {computational power of} a broader class of dynamical systems, including polynomial and analog models, and suggests that computational hardness may admit dynamical signatures in terms of Koopman spectral structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages double column; two figures</p></details> |

However, their application typically relies on full state information, which is often violated in real-world scenarios due to the availability of partial state information. In this work, we propose a neural network-based framework for the co-design of a safety controller, observer, and CBF for partially observed continuous-time systems. By formulating barrier conditions over an augmented state space, our approach ensures safety without requiring bounded estimation errors or handcrafted barrier functions. All components are jointly trained by formulating appropriate loss functions, and we introduce a validity condition to provide formal safety guarantees beyond the training data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There were errors in paper (introduction section and notations)</p></details> |

However, extending stability guarantees to trajectories defined on Riemannian manifolds poses significant challenges due to the manifold's geometric constraints. To address this, we propose a general framework for learning stable dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds using neural ordinary differential equations. Our method guarantees stability by projecting the neural vector field evolving on the manifold so that it strictly satisfies the Lyapunov stability criterion, ensuring stability at every system state. By leveraging a flexible neural parameterisation for both the base vector field and the Lyapunov function, our framework can accurately represent complex trajectories while respecting manifold constraints by evolving solutions directly on the manifold. We provide an efficient training strategy for applying our framework and demonstrate its utility by solving Riemannian LASA datasets on the unit quaternion (S^3) and symmetric positive-definite matrix manifolds, as well as robotic motions evolving on \mathbb{R}^3 \times S^3. We demonstrate the performance, scalability, and practical applicability of our approach through extensive simulations and by learning robot motions in a real-world experiment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Understanding why and how trained RNNs produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications, and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics could be gained through our method.</p></details> |  |

The approach models turbine dynamics using data-driven power coefficient maps expressed as combinations of compact radial basis functions and polynomial bases, parameterized in terms of tip-speed ratio and upstream conditions. These surrogate models are embedded in a first-order dynamic system suitable for model-based control. Experimental validation is carried out in two wind tunnel configurations: a low-turbulence tandem setup and a high-turbulence wind farm scenario. In the tandem case, the identified model is integrated into an adapted K\omega^2 controller, resulting in improved tip-speed ratio tracking and power stability compared to BEM-based and steady-state models. In the wind farm scenario, the model captures the statistical behavior of the turbines despite unresolved turbulence. The proposed method enables interpretable, adaptive control across a range of operating conditions without relying on black-box learning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Data-Centric Engineering Journal Length: 27 pages (including references) Figures: 14 numbered figures (from Fig. 1 to Fig. 14) Keywords: Wind Turbines, Wake Interaction, Nonlinear System Identification, Adaptive Control, RBF Regression, Model-Based Control, Wind Tunnel Experiments</p></details> |
| **[Nonlinear Filtering with Brenier Optimal Transport Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13886v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is concerned with the problem of nonlinear filtering, i.e., computing the conditional distribution of the state of a stochastic dynamical system given a history of noisy partial observations. Conventional sequential importance resampling (SIR) particle filters suffer from fundamental limitations, in scenarios involving degenerate likelihoods or high-dimensional states, due to the weight degeneracy issue. In this paper, we explore an alternative method, which is based on estimating the Brenier optimal transport (OT) map from the current prior distribution of the state to the posterior distribution at the next time step. Unlike SIR particle filters, the OT formulation does not require the analytical form of the likelihood. Moreover, it allows us to harness the approximation power of neural networks to model complex and multi-modal distributions and employ stochastic optimization algorithms to enhance scalability. Extensive numerical experiments are presented that compare the OT method to the SIR particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter, evaluating the performance in terms of sample efficiency, high-dimensional scalability, and the ability to capture complex and multi-modal distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 17 figures, 1 Table</p></details> |
| **[A highly efficient second-order accurate long-time dynamics preserving scheme for some geophysical fluid models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05360v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop and analyze a highly efficient, second-order time-marching scheme for infinite-dimensional nonlinear geophysical fluid models, designed to accurately approximate invariant measures-that is, the stationary statistical properties (or climate) of the underlying dynamical system. Beyond second-order accuracy in time, the scheme is particularly well suited for long-time simulations due to two key features: it requires solving only a fixed symmetric positive-definite linear system with constant coefficients at each step; and it guarantees long-time stability, producing uniformly bounded solutions in time for any bounded external forcing, regardless of initial data. For prototypical models such as the barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation, the method preserves dissipativity, ensuring that numerical solutions remain bounded in a function space compactly embedded in the phase space as time tends to infinity. Leveraging this property, we rigorously prove convergence of both global attractors and invariant measures of the discrete system to those of the continuous model in the vanishing time-step limit. A central innovation of the method is a mean-reverting scalar auxiliary variable (mr-SAV) formulation, which preserves the dissipative structure of externally forced systems within an appropriate phase space. For the infinite-dimensional models considered, we additionally employ fractional-order function spaces to establish compactness of numerical solutions in topologies compatible with the phase space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Koopman Control Factorization: Data-Driven Convex Controller Design for a Class of Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05359v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Koopman operators provide a global linearization for autonomous dynamical systems, nonautonomous systems are not globally linear in the inputs. State (or output) feedback controller design therefore remains nonconvex in typical formulations, even with approximations via bilinear control-affine terms. We address this gap by introducing the Koopman Control Factorization, a novel parameterization of control-affine dynamical systems combined with a feedback controller defined as a linear combination of nonlinear measurements. With this choice, the Koopman operator of the closed-loop system is a bilinear combination of the coefficients in two matrices: one representing the system, and the other the controller. We propose a set of sufficient conditions such that the factorization holds. Then, we present an algorithm that calculates the feedback matrix via semi-definite programming, producing a Lyapunov-stable closed-loop system with convex optimization. We evaluate the proposed controllers on two canonical examples of control-affine nonlinear systems (inverted pendulums), and show that our factorization and controller successfully stabilize both under properly-chosen basis functions. This manuscript introduces a broadly generalizable control synthesis method for stabilization of nonlinear systems that is quick-to-compute, verifiably stable, data-driven, and does not rely on approximations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure (with 4 subfigures).

Given the trajectories for a subset of state variables, the remaining follow a Gaussian distribution. Despite the conditionally linear structure, the CGNS exhibits strong nonlinearity, thus capturing many non-Gaussian characteristics observed in nature through its joint and marginal distributions. Desirably, it enjoys closed analytic formulae for the time evolution of its conditional Gaussian statistics, which facilitate the study of data assimilation and other related topics. In this paper, we develop a martingale-free approach to improve the understanding of CGNSs. This methodology provides a tractable approach to proving the time evolution of the conditional statistics by deriving results through time discretization schemes, with the continuous-time regime obtained via a formal limiting process as the discretization time-step vanishes. This discretized approach further allows for developing analytic formulae for optimal posterior sampling of unobserved state variables with correlated noise. These tools are particularly valuable for studying extreme events and intermittency and apply to high-dimensional systems. Moreover, the approach improves the understanding of different sampling methods in characterizing uncertainty. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a physics-constrained, triad-interaction climate model with cubic nonlinearity and state-dependent cross-interacting noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final revision with corrected typographical errors. 63 pages (Main Text pp. 1--26; Appendix pp. 27--53), 3 figures (all in Main Text).

| **[Neural Brain: A Neuroscience-inspired Framework for Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07634v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

We introduce a Monte Carlo path-inference framework that leverages full-path statistics and bridge processes to deliver reliable parameter estimation and model selection from coarsely sampled time series, without requiring analytical solutions. Crucially, we couple mechanistic stochastic models with their inference procedures to quantify how experimental design -specifically, sampling frequency and dataset size- governs estimator precision and model distinguishability. This analysis reveals optimal sampling regimes and sharp, resolution-dependent limits beyond which competing models become empirically indistinguishable. We validate the approach across four disparate systems -trajectories of optically trapped particles, human microbiome dynamics, social-media topic mentions, and forest population time series- recovering parameters and identifying when inference is fundamentally constrained by measurement resolution, thereby clarifying ongoing debates about dominant noise sources in these systems. Together, these results establish path-based Monte Carlo as a practical, general tool for inference and model discrimination in complex systems and provide principled guidelines for designing measurements that maximize information under real-world constraints.</p></details> |  |

We investigate the Set Cover Problem (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing optimization solvers by learning to identify a smaller sub-problem that contains the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved instances and unsupervised learning to minimize the SCP objective. We evaluate the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size by 60-80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to 10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver), while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP's ability to generalize to larger problem sizes, training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances with up to 10,000 subsets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Graph Condensation via Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02565v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation reduces the size of large graphs while preserving performance, addressing the scalability challenges of Graph Neural Networks caused by computational inefficiencies on large datasets. Existing methods often rely on bi-level optimization, requiring extensive GNN training and limiting their scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph Condensation via Gaussian Process (GCGP), a novel and computationally efficient approach to graph condensation. GCGP utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP), with the condensed graph serving as observations, to estimate the posterior distribution of predictions. This approach eliminates the need for the iterative and resource-intensive training typically required by GNNs. To enhance the capability of the GCGP in capturing dependencies between function values, we derive a specialized covariance function that incorporates structural information. This covariance function broadens the receptive field of input nodes by local neighborhood aggregation, thereby facilitating the representation of intricate dependencies within the nodes. To address the challenge of optimizing binary structural information in condensed graphs, Concrete random variables are utilized to approximate the binary adjacency matrix in a continuous counterpart. This relaxation process allows the adjacency matrix to be represented in a differentiable form, enabling the application of gradient-based optimization techniques to discrete graph structures. Experimental results show that the proposed GCGP method efficiently condenses large-scale graph data while preserving predictive performance, addressing the scalability and efficiency challenges. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/GCGP.</p></details> |  |

While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 22 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Interpreting GNN-based IDS Detections Using Provenance Graph Structural Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00934v7)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced cyber threats (e.g., Fileless Malware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)) have driven the adoption of provenance-based security solutions. These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338v4)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

| **[GNN-based Path Embeddings for Efficient and Exact Subgraph Matching (Technical Report)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15641v4)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classic problem of exact subgraph matching returns those subgraphs in a large-scale data graph that are isomorphic to a given query graph, which has gained increasing importance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based path embedding framework (GNN-PE), which allows efficient exact subgraph matching without introducing false dismissals. Unlike traditional GNN-based graph embeddings that only produce approximate subgraph matching results, in this paper, we carefully devise GNN-based embeddings for paths, such that: if two paths (and 1-hop neighbors of vertices on them) have the subgraph relationship, their corresponding GNN-based embedding vectors will strictly follow the dominance relationship. With such a newly designed property of path dominance embeddings, we are able to propose effective pruning strategies based on path label/dominance embeddings and guarantee no false dismissals for subgraph matching. We build multidimensional indexes over path embedding vectors, and develop an efficient subgraph matching algorithm by traversing indexes over graph partitions in parallel and applying our pruning methods. We also propose a cost-model-based query plan that obtains query paths from the query graph with low query cost. To further optimize our GNN-PE approach, we also propose a more efficient GNN-based path group embedding (GNN-PGE) technique, which performs subgraph matching over grouped path embedding vectors. We design effective pruning strategies (w.r.t. grouped path embeddings) that can significantly reduce the search space during the index traversal. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GNN-PE and GNN-PGE approaches for exact subgraph matching on both real and synthetic graph data.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112), and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Predictive Intelligence in Medicine Workshop (MICCAI PRIME) 2025; 13 pages</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Personalized PageRank and Higher-Order Topological Structures for Heterophily Mitigation in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16347v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in node classification tasks but often assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar labels. This assumption does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks, HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness. The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution for real-world graph learning challenges.

| **[Meta-Learning Based Few-Shot Graph-Level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07847v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD), incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size, mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ARRML2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-Driven Federated Graph Learning on Model Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12624v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative graph representation learning, enabling multiple parties to jointly train models while preserving data privacy. However, most existing approaches assume homogeneous client models and largely overlook the challenge of model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL), which frequently arises in practice when organizations employ graph neural networks (GNNs) of different scales and architectures.Such architectural diversity not only undermines smooth server-side aggregation, which presupposes a unified representation space shared across clients' updates, but also further complicates the transfer and integration of structural knowledge across clients. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy gain of 3.74% over baselines in MHtFGL scenarios, while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.</p></details> |  |

DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves, it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering, sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified DGTEN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance for this problem, but costly graph construction, irregular computations, and random memory access patterns substantially limit their throughput. The recently proposed Hashing-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT) offers a theoretically guaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its evaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object condensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step (e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime. In this work, we make two contributions. First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking performance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same dataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a lightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts track assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular, hardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference. On the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event on an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency. These results position HEPTv2 as a practical, scalable alternative to GNN-based pipelines for fast tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop</p></details> |

While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+ achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICTAI 2025.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint was submitted to IEEE TrustCom 2025.

| **[AMBER: Adaptive Mesh Generation by Iterative Mesh Resolution Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23663v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh. Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation. Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e., a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[GNN-enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection for Next-Generation SDN-Enabled Consumer Electronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07109v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Graph Condensation: Advancing Data Versatility through Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17063v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing computation of training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as a promising solution to synthesize a compact, substitute graph of the large-scale original graph for efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods predominantly employ classification as the surrogate task for optimization, thus excessively relying on node labels and constraining their utility in label-sparsity scenarios. More critically, this surrogate task tends to overfit class-specific information within the condensed graph, consequently restricting the generalization capabilities of GC for other downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Contrastive Graph Condensation (CTGC), which adopts a self-supervised surrogate task to extract critical, causal information from the original graph and enhance the cross-task generalizability of the condensed graph. Specifically, CTGC employs a dual-branch framework to disentangle the generation of the node attributes and graph structures, where a dedicated structural branch is designed to explicitly encode geometric information through nodes' positional embeddings. By implementing an alternating optimization scheme with contrastive loss terms, CTGC promotes the mutual enhancement of both branches and facilitates high-quality graph generation through the model inversion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTGC excels in handling various downstream tasks with a limited number of labels, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art GC methods.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/orfeld415/NAVIS</p></details> | preprint |

Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. To bridge the two, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, NAR-*ICP, that learns the intermediate computations of classical ICP-based registration algorithms, extending the CLRS Benchmark. We evaluate our approach across real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex inputs, and its potential to be used within larger learning pipelines. Our method achieves superior performance compared to the baselines, even surpassing the algorithms it was trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 16 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data. Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations. Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity, MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing multi-omics integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalization of Graph Neural Networks for AC Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06860v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times. Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to 10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical, generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print has been submitted for review</p></details> |

We propose a novel integration framework that enables effective fusion between powerful pre-trained text encoders and Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs). Our method enhances the alignment of textual and structural representations through a bidirectional fusion mechanism and contrastive node-level optimization. To evaluate the approach, we train two variants using different PLMs: Snowflake-Embed (state-of-the-art) and GTE-base, each paired with an R-GCN backbone. Experiments on five heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that our integration method achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, surpassing existing GNN and large language model-based approaches. Notably, Snowflake-Embed + R-GCN improves accuracy on the Texas dataset by over 8\% and on Wisconsin by nearly 5\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our fusion strategy for advancing text-rich graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Aware Compound-Protein Affinity Prediction via Graph Neural Network with Group Lasso Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03318v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end explainable models for structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as the limited number of compound-protein interaction activity data for specific protein targets, and plenty of subtle changes in molecular configuration sites significantly affecting molecular properties. We exploit pairs of molecules with activity cliffs that share scaffolds but differ at substituent sites, characterized by large potency differences for specific protein targets. We propose a framework by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage property and structure information from activity cliff pairs to predict compound-protein affinity (i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). To enhance model performance and explainability, we train GNNs with structure-aware loss functions using group lasso and sparse group lasso regularizations, which prune and highlight molecular subgraphs relevant to activity differences. We applied this framework to activity cliff data of molecules targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (PDB IDs: 1O42, 2H8H, 4MXO). Our approach improved property prediction by integrating common and uncommon node information with sparse group lasso, as reflected in reduced root mean squared error (RMSE) and improved Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Applying regularizations also enhances feature attribution for GNN by boosting graph-level global direction scores and improving atom-level coloring accuracy. These advances strengthen model interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly for identifying critical molecular substructures in lead optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Spatiotemporal Graph Learning with Direct Volumetric Information Passing and Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18013v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven learning of physical systems has kindled significant attention, where many neural models have been developed. In particular, mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling spatiotemporal dynamics across arbitrary geometric domains. However, the existing node-edge message-passing and aggregation mechanism in GNNs limits the representation learning ability. In this paper, we proposed a dual-module framework, Cell-embedded and Feature-enhanced Graph Neural Network (aka, CeFeGNN), for learning spatiotemporal dynamics. Specifically, we embed learnable cell attributions to the common node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial dependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local aggregation scheme from first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher order (e.g., from volume and edge to node), which takes advantage of volumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced block is designed to further improve the model's performance and alleviate the over-smoothness problem. Extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset demonstrate that CeFeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing the Effect of Embedding Norms and Singular Values to Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06066v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e., adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size (i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds. This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of the GNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey of Mamba Architectures for Medical Image Analysis: Classification, Segmentation, Restoration and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02362v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a special case of the State Space Model, is gaining popularity as an alternative to template-based deep learning approaches in medical image analysis. While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.</p></details> |  |

With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.</p></details> |  |

While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: CDCL-NLI, which extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 25,410 instances and spanning 26 languages. To address the limitations of previous methods on CDCL-NLI task, we further propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion with interpretability-aware prediction. Our approach leverages RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) within heterogeneous graph neural networks for cross-document context modeling, and employs a structure-aware semantic alignment based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU (Elementary Discourse Unit)-level attribution framework that produces extractive explanations.

| **[Uncertainty assessment in satellite-based greenhouse gas emissions estimates using emulated atmospheric transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05751v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales. However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their associated uncertainty. We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport "footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole fractions. While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks Truly Effective? A Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05750v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly, aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However, whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21 datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses, with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[QGraphLIME - Explaining Quantum Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05683v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design. Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world datasets, as quantum resources mature.

| **[Inductive inference of gradient-boosted decision trees on graphs for insurance fraud detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05676v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies. That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine (G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world, proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights into the predictions made by G-GBM.</p></details> |  |

| **[Soft-Evidence Fused Graph Neural Network for Cancer Driver Gene Identification across Multi-View Biological Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06290v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying cancer driver genes (CDGs) is essential for understanding cancer mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been employed to identify CDGs by capturing patterns in biological interaction networks. However, most GNN-based approaches rely on a single protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, ignoring complementary information from other biological networks. Some studies integrate multiple networks by aligning features with consistency constraints to learn unified gene representations for CDG identification. However, such representation-level fusion often assumes congruent gene relationships across networks, which may overlook network heterogeneity and introduce conflicting information. To address this, we propose Soft-Evidence Fusion Graph Neural Network (SEFGNN), a novel framework for CDG identification across multiple networks at the decision level. Instead of enforcing feature-level consistency, SEFGNN treats each biological network as an independent evidence source and performs uncertainty-aware fusion at the decision level using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). To alleviate the risk of overconfidence from DST, we further introduce a Soft Evidence Smoothing (SES) module that improves ranking stability while preserving discriminative performance. Experiments on three cancer datasets show that SEFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits strong potential in discovering novel CDGs.</p></details> | 8pages |

A Unified Empirical Study on Atomistic Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05583v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN - that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 8 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generative Dynamic Graph Representation Learning for Conspiracy Spoofing Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05562v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns. Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, ACM the web conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Exposure Mapping Functions for Inferring Heterogeneous Peer Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01722v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In causal inference, interference refers to the phenomenon in which the actions of peers in a network can influence an individual's outcome. Peer effect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for different levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed to the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects requires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define an exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer exposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions assume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent studies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture that different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of these works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning the exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function for the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity refers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure but different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure mapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in addition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and edge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face difficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms. Our comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network data shows that our method is more robust to different unknown underlying influence mechanisms when estimating heterogeneous peer effects when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fundamental Limits of Crystalline Equivariant Graph Neural Networks: A Circuit Complexity Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05494v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions. Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic, symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision, embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth, $O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentRouter: A Knowledge-Graph-Guided LLM Router for Collaborative Multi-Agent Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05445v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms. Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.</p></details> |  |

Recently, intrinsically interpretable GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs, and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs, balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[CHARME: A chain-based reinforcement learning approach for the minor embedding problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07124v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum annealing (QA) has great potential to solve combinatorial optimization problems efficiently. However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms is heavily based on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical graphs, into the quantum processing unit (QPU) whose topology is in the form of a limited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding problem. Because the minor embedding problem is an NP-hard problem~\mbox{\cite{Goodrich2018}}, existing methods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when faced with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor embedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition algorithm that ensures solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for effective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world instances, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed order exploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In particular, CHARME yields superior solutions in terms of qubit usage compared to fast embedding methods such as Minorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach, known for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases. In addition, our proposed exploration enhances the efficiency of the training of the CHARME framework by providing better solutions compared to the greedy strategy.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

| **[GILT: An LLM-Free, Tuning-Free Graph Foundational Model for In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04567v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for precessing relational data but often struggle to generalize to unseen graphs, giving rise to the development of Graph Foundational Models (GFMs). However, current GFMs are challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage, creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning \textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features. Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

We motivate the methodology through the classical correspondence of information theory with the physics of parabolic evolution equations. We integrate the fractional heat kernel into Graph Neural Network architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention, enhancing their expressiveness through adaptive, multi-hop diffusion. By applying Chebyshev polynomial approximations, large graphs become computationally feasible. Motivating variational formulations demonstrate that by extending the classical diffusion model to fractional powers of the Laplacian, nonlocal interactions deliver more globally diffusing labels. The particular balance between supervision of known labels and diffusion across the graph is particularly advantageous in the case where only a small number of labeled training examples are present. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on standard datasets.</p></details> |  |

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid GNN-IZR Framework for Fast and Empirically Robust AC Power Flow Analysis in Radial Distribution Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04264v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Alternating Current Power Flow (ACPF) problem forces a trade-off between the speed of data-driven models and the reliability of analytical solvers. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that synergizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the Implicit Z-Bus Recursive (IZR) method, a robust, non-iterative solver for radial distribution networks. The framework employs a physics-informed GNN for rapid initial predictions and invokes the IZR solver as a failsafe for stressed cases identified by a two-stage trigger. A failure is defined as any solution with a maximum power mismatch exceeding 0.1 p.u., a significant operational deviation. On a challenging test set of 7,500 stressed scenarios for the IEEE 33-bus system, the GNN-only model failed on 13.11 % of cases. In contrast, the hybrid framework identified all potential failures, delegating them to the IZR solver to achieve a 0.00 % failure rate, empirically matching the 100 % success rate of the analytical solver on this specific test set. An expanded ablation study confirms that both physics-informed training and Z-bus sensitivity features are critical, collaboratively reducing the GNN's failure rate from 98.72 % (data-only) to 13.11 %. The hybrid approach demonstrates a pragmatic path to achieving the empirical reliability of an analytical solver while leveraging GNN speed, enabling a significant increase in the number of scenarios analyzable in near real-time.</p></details> |  |

However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for \textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with \textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SeongJinAhn/DAD-SGM.</p></details> |  |

Previous works have addressed this problem either through classical planning methods or by learning state-based policies. They assume access to reliable state information, such as the precise object poses and environment models. In this work, we study base pose planning directly from top-down orthographic projections of the scene, which provide a global overview of the scene while preserving spatial structure. We propose VBM-NET, a learning-based method for base pose selection using such top-down orthographic projections. We use equivariant TransporterNet to exploit spatial symmetries and efficiently learn candidate base poses for grasping. Further, we use graph neural networks to represent a varying number of candidate base poses and use Reinforcement Learning to determine the optimal base pose among them. We show that VBM-NET can produce comparable solutions to the classical methods in significantly less computation time. Furthermore, we validate sim-to-real transfer by successfully deploying a policy trained in simulation to real-world mobile manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

While numerous innovative methods have been proposed to design cluster assignments and coarsening strategies, the relationships between clusters are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce Inter-cluster Connectivity Enhancement Pooling (ICEPool), a novel hierarchical pooling framework designed to enhance model's understanding of inter-cluster connectivity and ability of preserving the structural integrity in the original graph. ICEPool is compatible with a wide range of pooling-based GNN models. The deployment of ICEPool as an enhancement to existing models effectively combines the strengths of the original model with ICEPool's capability to emphasize the integration of inter-cluster connectivity, resulting in a more comprehensive and robust graph-level representation. Moreover, we make theoretical analysis to ICEPool's ability of graph reconstruction to demonstrate its effectiveness in learning inter-cluster relationship that is overlooked by conventional models.

In this paper, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of GNDEs with time-varying parameters in the infinite-node limit, providing theoretical insights into their size transferability. To this end, we introduce Graphon Neural Differential Equations (Graphon-NDEs) as the infinite-node limit of GNDEs and establish their well-posedness. Leveraging tools from graphon theory and dynamical systems, we prove the trajectory-wise convergence of GNDE solutions to Graphon-NDE solutions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence rates under two deterministic graph sampling regimes: (1) weighted graphs sampled from smooth graphons, and (2) unweighted graphs sampled from $\{0,1\}$-valued (discontinuous) graphons. We further establish size transferability bounds, providing theoretical justification for the practical strategy of transferring GNDE models trained on moderate-sized graphs to larger, structurally similar graphs without retraining. Numerical experiments using synthetic and real data support our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Higher-Order Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12841v3)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) and the related architectures from Topological Deep Learning are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Generation Powered with LLMs for Boosting Multivariate Time-Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03645v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sourced from multiple sensors and organized chronologically, Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) data involves crucial spatial-temporal dependencies. To capture these dependencies, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools. As explicit graphs are not inherent to MTS data, graph generation becomes a critical first step in adapting GNNs to this domain. However, existing approaches often rely solely on the data itself for MTS graph generation, leaving them vulnerable to biases from small training datasets. This limitation hampers their ability to construct effective graphs, undermining the accurate modeling of underlying dependencies in MTS data and reducing GNN performance in this field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, K-Link, leveraging the extensive universal knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce biases for powered MTS graph generation. To harness the knowledge within LLMs, such as physical principles, we design and extract a \textit{Knowledge-Link graph} that captures universal knowledge of sensors and their linkage. To empower MTS graph generation with the knowledge-link graph, we further introduce a graph alignment module that transfers universal knowledge from the knowledge-link graph to the graph generated from MTS data. This enhances the MTS graph quality, ensuring effective representation learning for MTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of K-Link for superior performance on various MTS tasks.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, fault detection methodologies should remain robust to evolving grid topologies caused by factors such as reconfigurations, equipment failures, and Distributed Energy Resource (DER) integration. Current data-driven state-of-the-art methods use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal modeling and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial learning, in an RNN+GNN pipeline setting (RGNN in short). Specifically, for power system fault diagnosis, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been adopted. Yet, various more advanced GNN architectures have been proposed and adopted in domains outside of power systems. In this paper, we set out to systematically and consistently benchmark various GNN architectures in an RNN+GNN pipeline model. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to (i) propose to use GraphSAGE and Graph Attention (GAT, GATv2) in an RGNN for fault diagnosis, and (ii) provide a comprehensive benchmark against earlier proposed RGNN solutions (RGCN) as well as pure RNN models (especially Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)), particularly (iii) exploring their generalization potential for deployment in different settings than those used for training them. Our experimental results on the IEEE 123-node distribution network show that RGATv2 has superior generalization capabilities, maintaining high performance with an F1-score reduction of $\sim$12% across different topology settings. In contrast, pure RNN models largely fail, experiencing an F1-score reduction of up to $\sim$60%, while other RGNN variants also exhibit significant performance degradation, i.e., up to $\sim$25% lower F1-scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted and accepted for IEEE SmartGridComm 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Node Feature Selection For Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03096v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrap Learning for Combinatorial Graph Alignment with Sequential GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03086v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference, this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Recently, machine learning classifiers based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model against nine established brain network classification methods across three multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore, the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance for real-world diagnostic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by Biomedical Signal Processing and Control and the code is available at https://github.com/TianzhengHU/BrainIB_coding/tree/main/BrainIB_GIB</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Transmission Grid Topology Control: Busbar Information Asymmetry and Heterogeneous Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07186v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factors such as the proliferation of renewable energy and electrification contribute to grid congestion as a pressing problem. Topology control is an appealing method for relieving congestion, but traditional approaches for topology discovery have proven too slow for practical application. Recent research has focused on machine learning (ML) as an efficient alternative. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are particularly well-suited for topology control applications due to their ability to model the graph structure of power grids. This study investigates the effect of the graph representation on GNN effectiveness for topology control. We identify the busbar information asymmetry problem inherent to the popular homogeneous graph representation. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation that resolves this problem. We apply GNNs with both representations and a fully connected neural network (FCNN) baseline on an imitation learning task. The models are evaluated by classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution network configurations, followed by FCNNs, and lastly, homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution network configurations than FCNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Towards Quantifying Long-Range Interactions in Graph Machine Learning: a Large Graph Dataset and a Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09008v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[VisitHGNN: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Modeling Point-of-Interest Visit Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02702v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how urban residents travel between neighborhoods and destinations is critical for transportation planning, mobility management, and public health. By mining historical origin-to-destination flow patterns with spatial, temporal, and functional relations among urban places, we estimate probabilities of visits from neighborhoods to specific destinations. These probabilities capture neighborhood-level contributions to citywide vehicular and foot traffic, supporting demand estimation, accessibility assessment, and multimodal planning. Particularly, we introduce VisitHGNN, a heterogeneous, relation-specific graph neural network designed to predict visit probabilities at individual Points of interest (POIs). POIs are characterized using numerical, JSON-derived, and textual attributes, augmented with fixed summaries of POI--POI spatial proximity, temporal co-activity, and brand affinity, while census block groups (CBGs) are described with 72 socio-demographic variables. CBGs are connected via spatial adjacency, and POIs and CBGs are linked through distance-annotated cross-type edges. Inference is constrained to a distance-based candidate set of plausible origin CBGs, and training minimizes a masked Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to yield probability distribution across the candidate set. Using weekly mobility data from Fulton County, Georgia, USA, VisitHGNN achieves strong predictive performance with mean KL divergence of 0.287, MAE of 0.008, Top-1 accuracy of 0.853, and R-square of 0.892, substantially outperforming pairwise MLP and distance-only baselines, and aligning closely with empirical visitation patterns (NDCG@50 = 0.966); Recall@5 = 0.611). The resulting distributions closely mirror observed travel behavior with high fidelity, highlighting the model's potential for decision support in urban planning, transportation policy, mobility system design, and public health.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Asymptomatic Nodes in Network Epidemics using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02568v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infected individuals in some epidemics can remain asymptomatic while still carrying and transmitting the infection. These individuals contribute to the spread of the epidemic and pose a significant challenge to public health policies. Identifying asymptomatic individuals is critical for measuring and controlling an epidemic, but periodic and widespread testing of healthy individuals is often too costly. This work tackles the problem of identifying asymptomatic individuals considering a classic SI (Susceptible-Infected) network epidemic model where a fraction of the infected nodes are not observed as infected (i.e., their observed state is identical to susceptible nodes). In order to classify healthy nodes as asymptomatic or susceptible, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with supervised learning is adopted where a set of node features are built from the network with observed infected nodes. The approach is evaluated across different network models, network sizes, and fraction of observed infections. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust across different scenarios, accurately identifying asymptomatic nodes while also generalizing to different network sizes and fraction of observed infections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented in the 35th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems (BRACIS)</p></details> |
| **[On The Expressive Power of GNN Derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02565v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN (HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture. Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism. Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong performance on popular graph learning tasks.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a powerful lens into large-scale functional connectivity, where brain regions are modeled as nodes and inter-regional synchrony as edges, offering clinically relevant biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. While prior works use graph neural network (GNN) approaches for disorder prediction, they remain complex black-boxes, limiting their reliability and clinical translation. In this work, we propose CONCEPTNEURO, a concept-based diagnosis framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and neurobiological domain knowledge to automatically generate, filter, and encode interpretable functional connectivity concepts. Each concept is represented as a structured subgraph linking specific brain regions, which are then passed through a concept classifier. Our design ensures predictions through clinically meaningful connectivity patterns, enabling both interpretability and strong predictive performance. Extensive experiments across multiple psychiatric disorder datasets demonstrate that CONCEPTNEURO-augmented GNNs consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts, improving accuracy while providing transparent, clinically aligned explanations. Furthermore, concept analyses highlight disorder-specific connectivity patterns that align with expert knowledge and suggest new hypotheses for future investigation, establishing CONCEPTNEURO as an interpretable, domain-informed framework for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Grained Urban Traffic Forecasting on Metropolis-Scale Road Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02278v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks (GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers Discover Molecular Structure Without Graph Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02259v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |

The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots that have limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graph neural network (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models -- trained using imitation learning -- outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. The results indicate the suitability of LPAC architectures for decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, 20 figures, Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

Multi-level LLM Enhanced Graph Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11997v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Rethinking Robust Graph Learning under Deficiencies with Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01910v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications, serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies, revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement (RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent, diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.</p></details> | 14 pages |

These reviews pose significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era.

Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Brain Causal Dynamics for Subject and Task Fingerprints using fMRI Time-series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06392v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models, driven by their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> |  |

Integrating physical laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However, training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training, especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring and molecular systems in up to 3 dimensions and 10,000 particles with different geometries, while retaining essential physical invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. Our proposed approach is benchmarked using a NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track publication to further demonstrate its versatility. We reveal that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, and an appendix</p></details> |
| **[LEAP: Local ECT-Based Learnable Positional Encodings for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00757v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm, where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet, standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs, Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate consistent function representations across architectures, vital for \textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer and algorithmic improvements. We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchy-Aware Neural Subgraph Matching with Enhanced Similarity Measure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00402v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions. Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability, scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency, offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph retrieval.

To address this, we introduce MUSE-Explainer, a new method that helps reveal how music Graph Neural Network models make decisions by providing clear, human-friendly explanations. Our approach generates counterfactual explanations by making small, meaningful changes to musical score graphs that alter a model's prediction while ensuring the results remain musically coherent. Unlike existing methods, MUSE-Explainer tailors its explanations to the structure of musical data and avoids unrealistic or confusing outputs. We evaluate our method on a music analysis task and show it offers intuitive insights that can be visualized with standard music tools such as Verovio.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th International Symposium on Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research (CMMR) 2025</p></details> |

While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.</p></details> |  |

Despite the availability of diverse search-based and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge, algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system, MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters, offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third, rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200 protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short paper.

We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation (PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while retaining adequate ergodic performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[scCDCG: Efficient Deep Structural Clustering for single-cell RNA-seq via Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06167v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is essential for unraveling cellular heterogeneity and diversity, offering invaluable insights for bioinformatics advancements. Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction. Our extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate scCDCG's superior performance and efficiency compared to 7 established models, underscoring scCDCG's potential as a transformative tool in scRNA-seq data analysis.

| **[Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26032v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework DGL to analyze and forecast industrial CO_2 emissions, addressing high feature correlation and capturing industrial-temporal interdependencies. Unlike traditional regression or clustering methods, our approach leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to model relationships between industries (or regions) and a temporal transformer to learn long-range patterns. We evaluate our framework on public global industry emissions dataset derived from EDGAR v8.0, spanning multiple countries and sectors. The proposed model achieves superior predictive performance - reducing error by over 15% compared to baseline deep models - while maintaining interpretability via attention weights and causal analysis. We believe that we are the first Graph-Temporal architecture that resolves multicollinearity by structurally encoding feature relationships, along with integration of causal inference to identify true drivers of emissions, improving transparency and fairness. We also stand a demonstration of policy relevance, showing how model insights can guide sector-specific decarbonization strategies aligned with sustainable development goals. Based on the above, we show high-emission "hotspots" and suggest equitable intervention plans, illustrating the potential of state-of-the-art AI graph learning to advance climate action, offering a powerful tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders to achieve carbon reduction targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 AI for Science Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiFIRec: Towards High-Frequency yet Low-Intention Behaviors for Multi-Behavior Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25755v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-behavior recommendation leverages multiple types of user-item interactions to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, providing personalized services in domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. Most existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec, that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Graph Coarsening for Efficient GNN Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25706v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular, we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoREX: Towards Self-Explainable Social Recommendation with Relevant Ego-Path Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00080v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommendation has been proven effective in addressing data sparsity in user-item interaction modeling by leveraging social networks. The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted explanations in SoREX. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/antman9914/SoREX.</p></details> | 27 pages, 10 figures |

An essential part of the ViG framework is the node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to prior vision GNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV submission. 13 pages, including the main text (8 pages), references, and supplementary material</p></details> |
