| **[PAINT: Parallel-in-time Neural Twins for Dynamical System Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16004v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems, while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. We argue, that a critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states in parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.</p></details> | 28 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Point Vortex Dynamics on Closed Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03684v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The theory of point vortex dynamics has existed since Kirchhoff's proposal in 1891 and is still under development with connections to many fields in mathematics. As a strong simplification of the concept of vorticity it excels in computational speed for vorticity based fluid simulations at the cost of accuracy. Recent finding by Stefanella Boatto and Jair Koiller allowed the extension of this theory on to closed surfaces. A comprehensive guide to point vortex dynamics on closed surfaces with genus zero and vanishing total vorticity is presented here. Additionally fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics and surfaces are explained in a way to unify the theory of point vortex dynamics of the plane, the sphere and closed surfaces together with implementation details and supplement material.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master Thesis, Technical University of Berlin</p></details> |
| **[Koopman Autoencoders with Continuous-Time Latent Dynamics for Fluid Dynamics Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02832v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven surrogate models have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating the simulation of turbulent flows. However, classical approaches which perform autoregressive rollouts often trade off between strong short-term accuracy and long-horizon stability. Koopman autoencoders, inspired by Koopman operator theory, provide a physics-based alternative by mapping nonlinear dynamics into a latent space where linear evolution is conducted. In practice, most existing formulations operate in a discrete-time setting, limiting temporal flexibility. In this work, we introduce a continuous-time Koopman framework that models latent evolution through numerical integration schemes. By allowing variable timesteps at inference, the method demonstrates robustness to temporal resolution and generalizes beyond training regimes. In addition, the learned dynamics closely adhere to the analytical matrix exponential solution, enabling efficient long-horizon forecasting. We evaluate the approach on classical CFD benchmarks and report accuracy, stability, and extrapolation properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[WAKESET: A Large-Scale, High-Reynolds Number Flow Dataset for Machine Learning of Turbulent Wake Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01379v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) offers transformative potential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD), promising to accelerate simulations, improve turbulence modelling, and enable real-time flow prediction and control-capabilities that could fundamentally change how engineers approach fluid dynamics problems. However, the exploration of ML in fluid dynamics is critically hampered by the scarcity of large, diverse, and high-fidelity datasets suitable for training robust models. This limitation is particularly acute for highly turbulent flows, which dominate practical engineering applications yet remain computationally prohibitive to simulate at scale. High-Reynolds number turbulent datasets are essential for ML models to learn the complex, multi-scale physics characteristic of real-world flows, enabling generalisation beyond the simplified, low-Reynolds number regimes often represented in existing datasets. This paper introduces WAKESET, a novel, large-scale CFD dataset of highly turbulent flows, designed to address this critical gap. The dataset captures the complex hydrodynamic interactions during the underwater recovery of an autonomous underwater vehicle by a larger extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle. It comprises 1,091 high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, augmented to 4,364 instances, covering a wide operational envelope of speeds (up to Reynolds numbers of 1.09 x 10^8) and turning angles. This work details the motivation for this new dataset by reviewing existing resources, outlines the hydrodynamic modelling and validation underpinning its creation, and describes its structure. The dataset's focus on a practical engineering problem, its scale, and its high turbulence characteristics make it a valuable resource for developing and benchmarking ML models for flow field prediction, surrogate modelling, and autonomous navigation in complex underwater environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sample-Efficient Diffusion-based Control of Complex Physics Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17893v2)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling complex physics systems is important in diverse domains. While diffusion-based methods have demonstrated advantages over classical model-based approaches and myopic sequential learning methods in achieving global trajectory consistency, they are limited by sample efficiency.This paper presents SEDC (Sample-Efficient Diffusion-based Control), a novel framework addressing core challenges in complex physics systems: high-dimensional state-control spaces, strong nonlinearities, and the gap between non-optimal training data and near-optimal control laws.Our approach introduces a novel control paradigm by architecturally decoupling state-control modeling and decomposing dynamics, while a guided self-finetuning process iteratively refines the control law towards optimality. We validate SEDC across diverse complex nonlinear systems, including high-dimensional fluid dynamics (Burgers), chaotic synchronization networks (Kuramoto), and real-world power grid stability control (Swing Equation). Our method achieves 39.5\%-47.3\% better control accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using only 10\% of the training samples. The implementation is available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DIFOCON-C019}{here}.</p></details> |  |
| **[FISC: A Fluid-Inspired Framework for Decentralized and Scalable Swarm Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00480v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving scalable coordination in large robotic swarms is often constrained by reliance on inter-agent communication, which introduces latency, bandwidth limitations, and vulnerability to failure. To address this gap, a decentralized approach for outer-loop control of large multi-agent systems based on the paradigm of how a fluid moves through a volume is proposed and evaluated. A relationship between fundamental fluidic element properties and individual robotic agent states is developed such that the corresponding swarm "flows" through a space, akin to a fluid when forced via a pressure boundary condition. By ascribing fluid-like properties to subsets of agents, the swarm evolves collectively while maintaining desirable structure and coherence without explicit communication of agent states within or outside of the swarm. The approach is evaluated using simulations involving $O(10^3)$ quadcopter agents and compared against Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions for a converging-diverging domain. Quantitative agreement between swarm-derived and CFD fields is assessed using Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), yielding normalized errors of 0.15-0.9 for velocity, 0.61-0.98 for density, 0-0.937 for pressure. These results demonstrate the feasibility of treating large robotic swarms as continuum systems that retain the macroscopic structure derived from first principles, providing a basis for scalable and decentralized control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Neural Operators for Parametric PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04576v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on parameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional numerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making parameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning advances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution operators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two main paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and excel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g., DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization. Through comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups of $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query scenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance for method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation, convergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional parameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This work establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers via operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource for this rapidly evolving field</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Learning Transient Convective Heat Transfer with Geometry Aware World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22086v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equation (PDE) simulations are fundamental to engineering and physics but are often computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalization capabilities on unseen geometric configurations, highlighting both its potential for controlled simulation synthesis and current limitations in spatial precision for out-of-distribution samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Particles to Agents: Hallucination as a Metric for Cognitive Friction in Spatial Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21977v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional architectural simulations (e.g. Computational Fluid Dynamics, evacuation, structural analysis) model elements as deterministic physics-based "particles" rather than cognitive "agents". To bridge this, we introduce \textbf{Agentic Environmental Simulations}, where Large Multimodal generative models actively predict the next state of spatial environments based on semantic expectation. Drawing on examples from accessibility-oriented AR pipelines and multimodal digital twins, we propose a shift from chronological time-steps to Episodic Spatial Reasoning, where simulations advance through meaningful, surprisal-triggered events. Within this framework we posit AI hallucinations as diagnostic tools. By formalizing the \textbf{Cognitive Friction} ($C_f$) it is possible to reveal "Phantom Affordances", i.e. semiotic ambiguities in built space. Finally, we challenge current HCI paradigms by treating environments as dynamic cognitive partners and propose a human-centered framework of cognitive orchestration for designing AI-driven simulations that preserve autonomy, affective clarity, and cognitive integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper selected for the workshop Human Cognition, AI, and the Future of HCI: Navigating the Disruptive and Wild Landscape of Large Language Models and Agentic AI as part of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) conference of the Alpine region (AlpCHI 2026) hosted at the Congressi Stefano Franscini, March 1st to March 5th, 2026 on Monte Verità in Ascona, Switzerland</p></details> |
| **[Goal-Driven Adaptive Sampling Strategies for Machine Learning Models Predicting Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21832v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models are widely regarded as a way forward to tackle multi-query challenges that arise once expensive black-box simulations such as computational fluid dynamics are investigated. However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill. Results are presented for the NASA common research model for an uncertainty propagation task showcasing high level of accuracy at significantly smaller cost compared to an approach without active learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM4Fluid: Large Language Models as Generalizable Neural Solvers for Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21681v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/qisongxiao/LLM4Fluid.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Pulsatile Flow Prediction for Realistic, Diverse Intracranial Aneurysm Morphologies using a Graph Transformer and Steady-Flow Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19876v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentFlow: Investigating Fluid Dynamics of Intent Communication in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22134v4)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI shifts interaction toward intent-based outcome specification, despite user intents being inherently vague, fluid, and evolving. While a growing body of HCI research has proposed diverse interaction techniques to support this process, there is limited understanding of what the key aspects of intent communication are and how they interplay to shape users' workflows. To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic literature review of 46 HCI papers and identify four core aspects of intent communication support: intent articulation, exploration, management, and synchronization. To investigate how these aspects interplay in practice, we developed IntentFlow, a research probe that embodies all four aspects for a writing task, and conducted a comparative study (N=12). Our action-level behavioral analysis reveals that comprehensive support enables verification-driven refinement and progressive intent curation, reduces cognitive effort, and improves users' sense of control and understanding of intent-output alignment. We conclude with design implications for building generative AI systems that support intent communication as a dynamic, iterative process.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-Informed Local Subspaces Method for Error-Bounded Lossy Compression of Large-Scale Scientific Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20113v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing volume of scientific simulation data presents a significant challenge for storage and transfer. Error-bounded lossy compression has emerged as a critical solution for mitigating these challenges, providing a means to reduce data size while ensuring that reconstructed data remains valid for scientific analysis. In this paper, we present a data-driven scientific data compressor, called Discontinuous Data-informed Local Subspaces (Discontinuous DLS), to improve compression-to-error ratios over data-agnostic compressors. This error-bounded compressor leverages localized spatial and temporal subspaces, informed by the underlying data structure, to enhance compression efficiency and preserve key features. The presented technique is flexible and applicable to a wide range of scientific data, including fluid dynamics, environmental simulations, and other high-dimensional, time-dependent datasets. We describe the core principles of the method and demonstrate its ability to significantly reduce storage requirements without compromising critical data fidelity. The technique is implemented in a distributed computing environment using MPI, and its performance is evaluated against state-of-the-art error-bounded compression methods in terms of compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy. This study highlights discontinuous DLS as a promising approach for large-scale scientific data compression in high-performance computing environments, providing a robust solution for managing the growing data demands of modern scientific simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems</p></details> |
| **[AI Agent for Reverse-Engineering Legacy Finite-Difference Code and Translating to Devito](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18381v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To facilitate the transformation of legacy finite difference implementations into the Devito environment, this study develops an integrated AI agent framework. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and open-source Large Language Models are combined through multi-stage iterative workflows in the system's hybrid LangGraph architecture. The agent constructs an extensive Devito knowledge graph through document parsing, structure-aware segmentation, extraction of entity relationships, and Leiden-based community detection. GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[DDFKs: Fluid Simulation with Dynamic Divergence-Free Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17693v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid simulations based on memory-efficient spatial representations like implicit neural spatial representations (INSRs) and Gaussian spatial representation (GSR), where the velocity fields are parameterized by neural networks or weighted Gaussian functions, has been an emerging research area. Though advantages over traditional discretizations like spatial adaptivity and continuous differentiability of these spatial representations are leveraged by fluid solvers, solving the time-dependent PDEs that governs the fluid dynamics remain challenging, especially in incompressible fluids where the divergence-free constraint is enforced. In this paper, we propose a grid-free solver Dynamic Divergence-Free Kernels (DDFKs) for incompressible flows based on divergence-free kernels (DFKs). Each DFK is incorporated with a matrix-valued radial basis function and a vector-valued weight, yielding a divergence-free vector field. We model the continuous flow velocity as the sum of multiple DFKs, thus enforcing incompressibility while being able to preserve different level of details. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves comparable accuracy, robustness, ability to preserve vortices, time and memory efficiency and generality across diverse phenomena to state-of-the-art methods using memory-efficient spatial representations, while excels at maintaining incompressibility. Though our first-order solver are slower than fluid solvers with traditional discretizations, our approach exhibits significantly lower numerical dissipation due to reduced discretization error. We demonstrate our method on diverse incompressible flow examples with rich vortices and various solid boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDBench: Benchmarking Data-Driven Methods for Model Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20529v3)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs, respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise. MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFO: Learning PDE Operators via Spectral Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17090v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern complex systems, yet neural operators often struggle to efficiently capture the long-range, nonlocal interactions inherent in their solution maps. We introduce Spectral Filtering Operator (SFO), a neural operator that parameterizes integral kernels using the Universal Spectral Basis (USB), a fixed, global orthonormal basis derived from the eigenmodes of the Hilbert matrix in spectral filtering theory. Motivated by our theoretical finding that the discrete Green's functions of shift-invariant PDE discretizations exhibit spatial Linear Dynamical System (LDS) structure, we prove that these kernels admit compact approximations in the USB. By learning only the spectral coefficients of rapidly decaying eigenvalues, SFO achieves a highly efficient representation. Across six benchmarks, including reaction-diffusion, fluid dynamics, and 3D electromagnetics, SFO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing error by up to 40% relative to strong baselines while using substantially fewer parameters.</p></details> |  |

While neural networks have shown promise as efficient alternatives to expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, their applicability is often constrained by data scarcity and poor generalization across different aerodynamic domains. To address these challenges, we propose UniField, a unified framework that enables joint training across multiple aerodynamic domains including automobiles, trains, aircraft. UniField employs a shared geometry encoder to extract domain-agnostic representations from surface point clouds, and integrates domain-specific flow information through Parallel Flow-Conditioned Adaptive LayerNorm (PFC-AdaLN). In addition to consolidating existing datasets from specialized research field including automobiles, trains and aircraft, we further introduce ThingiCFD, a large-scale CFD dataset constructed from Thingi10k geometries with extensive flow condition randomization, substantially expanding geometric and flow diversity during training. UniField achieves SOTA performance on the public DrivAerNet++ benchmark. In addition, our experiments demonstrate that joint multi-domain training consistently improves surface pressure prediction accuracy, particularly in data-scarce domains. These results highlight the potential of UniField as a foundation model for data-driven aerodynamic modeling. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/zoujunhong/UniField.</p></details> |  |

Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols.

One of the key challenges of HPC codes is performance portability, i.e. the ability to maintain near-optimal performance across different accelerators. In the context of the \textbf{REFMAP} project, which targets scalable, GPU-enabled multi-fidelity CFD for urban airflow prediction, this paper analyzes the performance portability of SOD2D, a state-of-the-art Spectral Elements simulation framework across AMD and NVIDIA GPU architectures. We first discuss the physical and numerical models underlying SOD2D, highlighting its computational hotspots. Then, we examine its performance and scalability in a multi-level manner, i.e. defining and characterizing an extensive full-stack design space spanning across application, software and hardware infrastructure related parameters. Single-GPU performance characterization across server-grade NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures and vendor-specific compiler stacks, show the potential as well as the diverse effect of memory access optimizations, i.e. 0.69$\times$ - 3.91$\times$ deviations in acceleration speedup. Performance variability of SOD2D at scale is further examined on the LUMI multi-GPU cluster, where profiling reveals similar throughput variations, highlighting the limits of performance projections and the need for multi-level, informed tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>DATE ...</summary><p>DATE 26 conference Multi-Partner Project Paper</p></details> |
| **[Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16417v4)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Solve Optimization Problems Constrained with Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24573v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables, and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints. This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation, heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaggerFFT: A Distributed FFT Framework Using Task Scheduling in Julia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12209v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a fundamental numerical technique with widespread application in a range of scientific problems. As scientific simulations attempt to exploit exascale systems, there has been a growing demand for distributed FFT algorithms that can effectively utilize modern heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Conventional FFT algorithms commonly encounter performance bottlenecks, especially when run on heterogeneous platforms. Most distributed FFT approaches rely on static task distribution and require synchronization barriers, limiting scalability and impacting overall resource utilization. In this paper we present DaggerFFT, a distributed FFT framework, developed in Julia, that treats highly parallel FFT computations as a dynamically scheduled task graph. Each FFT stage operates on a separately defined distributed array. FFT operations are expressed as DTasks operating on pencil or slab partitioned DArrays. Each FFT stage owns its own DArray, and the runtime assigns DTasks across devices using Dagger's dynamic scheduler that uses work stealing. We demonstrate how DaggerFFT's dynamic scheduler can outperform state-of-the-art distributed FFT libraries on both CPU and GPU backends, achieving up to a 2.6x speedup on CPU clusters and up to a 1.35x speedup on GPU clusters. We have integrated DaggerFFT into Oceananigans.jl, a geophysical fluid dynamics framework, demonstrating that high-level, task-based runtimes can deliver both superior performance and modularity in large-scale, real-world simulations.</p></details> |  |

However, most current research focuses on selecting tools from an existing pool. A more fundamental, yet largely overlooked, problem is how to populate this pool by converting the vast number of existing software projects into MCP-compatible services. To bridge this gap, we introduce Code2MCP, an agent-based framework that automatically transforms a GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Code2MCP employs a multi-agent workflow for code analysis, environment setup, tool function design, and service generation, enhanced by a self-correcting loop to ensure reliability. We demonstrate that Code2MCP successfully transforms open-source computing libraries in scientific fields such as bioinformatics, mathematics, and fluid dynamics that are not available in existing MCP servers. By providing a novel automated pathway to unlock GitHub, the world's largest code repository, for the MCP ecosystem, Code2MCP serves as a catalyst to significantly accelerate the protocol's adoption and practical application. The code is public at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/Code2MCP.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</p></details> |  |

The complex dynamics result from the multiple interconnected cylinder structure and the difference in fluid rates of the cylinders. These characteristics complicate detailed simulation for all joints, making it unsuitable for reinforcement learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose an analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics to represent the complicated actuators. The model predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, allowing rapid processing in RL environments. We compare our model with neural network-based actuator models and demonstrate the advantages of our model in data-limited scenarios. The locomotion policy trained in RL with our model is deployed on a hydraulic quadruped robot, which is over 300 kg. This work is the first demonstration of a successful transfer of stable and robust command-tracking locomotion with RL on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, demonstrating advanced sim-to-real transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) 2025</p></details> |

Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes. Both stages are efficiently solved by a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets demonstrate that CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in terms of mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing.

| **[SPIKE: Sparse Koopman Regularization for Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10282v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A reduced-order derivative-informed neural operator for subsurface fluid-flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13620v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.</p></details> |  |

However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications.

| **[A Mesh-Adaptive Hypergraph Neural Network for Unsteady Flow Around Oscillating and Rotating Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22252v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks, recently introduced into the field of fluid flow surrogate modeling, have been successfully applied to model the temporal evolution of various fluid flow systems. Existing applications, however, are mostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work extends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow around structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we propose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate model with part of the mesh/graph co-rotating with the structure and part of the mesh/graph static. A single layer of interface cells are constructed at the interface between the two parts and are allowed to distort and adapt, which helps in circumventing the difficulty of interpolating information encoded by the neural network at every graph neural network layer. Dedicated reconstruction and re-projection schemes are designed to counter the error caused by the distortion and connectivity change of the interface cells. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow around a 2D oscillating airfoil, and (ii) fluid flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model achieves stable rollout predictions over hundreds or even a thousand time steps. We further demonstrate that one could enforce accurate, error-bounded prediction results by incorporating the measurements from sparse pressure sensors. In addition to the accurate flow field predictions, the lift and drag force predictions closely match with the computational fluid dynamics calculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling fluid flow around rotating structures, and paving the path towards a graph neural network-based surrogate model for more complex scenarios like flow around marine propellers.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026.

Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement learning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow, circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, the ability of these ML models to generalize beyond the training distribution remains an open question. In this study, we evaluate the climate response of several state-of-the-art ML models (ACE2-ERA5, NeuralGCM, and cBottle) to a uniform sea surface temperature warming, a widely used benchmark for evaluating climate change. We assess each ML model's performance relative to a physics-based general circulation model (NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory AM4) across key diagnostics, including surface air temperature, precipitation, temperature and wind profiles, and top-of-atmosphere radiation. While the ML models reproduce key aspects of the physical model response, particularly the response of precipitation, some exhibit notable departures from robust physical responses, including radiative responses and land region warming. Our results highlight the promise and current limitations of ML models for climate change applications and suggest that further improvements are needed for robust out-of-sample generalization.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning models are gaining popularity for solving this problem due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data and to generalize across diverse conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as being particularly powerful for generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for leveraging them in fluid dynamics research and applications ranging from super-resolution to reconstructions of experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Physics of Fluids, code and data can be found at https://github.com/tum-pbs/sparse-reconstruction</p></details> |

Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accec...</summary><p>Accecpted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

| **[Odd-DC: Generalizable Neural Model Reduction via Odd Difference-of-Convex Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18241v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction is essential for real-time simulation of deformable objects. Linear techniques such as PCA provide structured and predictable behavior, but their limited expressiveness restricts accuracy under large or nonlinear deformations. Nonlinear model reduction with neural networks offers richer representations and higher compression; however, without structural constraints, the learned mapping from latent coordinates to displacements often generalizes poorly beyond the training distribution. We present an odd difference-of-convex (DC) neural formulation that bridges linear and nonlinear model reduction. Our goal is to obtain a latent space that behaves reliably under unseen load magnitudes and directions. To improve extrapolation in magnitude, we introduce convexity into the decoder to discourage oscillatory responses. Yet convexity alone cannot represent the odd symmetry required by many symmetric systems, which is crucial for generalization to inverse force directions. We therefore adopt a DC formulation that preserves the stabilizing effect of convexity while explicitly enforcing odd symmetry. Practically, we realize this structure using an input-convex neural network (ICNN) augmented with symmetry constraints. Across challenging deformation scenarios with varying magnitudes and reversed load directions, our method demonstrates stronger generalization than unconstrained nonlinear reductions while maintaining compact latent spaces and real-time performance. Our DC formulation extends to both mesh-based and neural-field reductions, demonstrating applicability across multiple classes of neural nonlinear model reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Operator Inference for Model Reduction of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12161v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction enables efficient simulation of complex dynamical systems by constructing low-dimensional surrogate models from high-dimensional data. The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-preserving Lift & Learn: Scientific machine learning for nonlinear conservative partial differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00301v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents structure-preserving Lift & Learn, a scientific machine learning method that employs lifting variable transformations to learn structure-preserving reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with conservation laws. We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active inference and artificial reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21129v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate Trajectories Along Probability Flows: Pseudo Markovian Alternative to Mori Zwanzig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00015v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction techniques have emerged as a powerful paradigm across different fronts of scientific computing. Despite their success, the provided tools and methodologies remain limited if high-dimensional dynamical systems subject to initial uncertainty and/or stochastic noise are encountered; in particular if rare events are of interest. We address this open challenge by borrowing ideas from Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Chorin's optimal prediction method. The novelty of our work lies on employing time-dependent optimal projection of the dynamic on a desired set of resolved variables. We show several theoretical and numerical properties of our model reduction approach. In particular, we show that the devised surrogate trajectories are consistent with the probability flow of the full-order system. Furthermore, we identify the measure underlying the projection through polynomial chaos expansion technique. This allows us to efficiently compute the projection even for trajectories that are initiated on low probability events. Moreover, we investigate the introduced model-reduction error of the surrogate trajectories on a standard setup, characterizing the convergence behaviour of the scheme. Several numerical results highlight the computational advantages of the proposed scheme in comparison to Monte-Carlo and optimal prediction method. Through this framework, we demonstrate that by tracking the measure along with the consistent projection of the dynamic we are able to access accurate estimates of different statistics including observables conditional on a given initial configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Model Reduction using WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11090v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many problems in science and engineering involve time-dependent, high dimensional datasets arising from complex physical processes, which are costly to simulate. In this work, we propose WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics, a data-driven nonlinear model reduction framework to build a low-dimensional surrogate model for complex evolution systems. Given time-dependent training data, we split the time domain into multiple overlapping windows, within which nonlinear dimension reduction is performed by auto-encoders to capture latent codes. Once a low-dimensional representation of the data is learned, a propagator network is trained to capture the evolution of the latent codes in each window, and a transcoder is trained to connect the latent codes between adjacent windows. The proposed windowed decomposition significantly simplifies propagator training by breaking long-horizon dynamics into multiple short, manageable segments, while the transcoders ensure consistency across windows. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we develop a mathematical theory establishing the representation power of WeldNet under the manifold hypothesis, justifying the success of nonlinear model reduction via deep autoencoder-based architectures. Our numerical experiments on various differential equations indicate that WeldNet can capture nonlinear latent structures and their underlying dynamics, outperforming both traditional projection-based approaches and recently developed nonlinear model reduction methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited hardware resources on today's mobile platforms hinder these applications, as they struggle to achieve real-time performance. In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices. Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\times$ speedup and 32.3\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</p></details> | 28 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Dynamic Shape Control of Soft Robots Enabled by Data-Driven Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03931v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 8 Figures |

The Kempf-Ness theorem is used to establish that the $L^2$ regularizer is minimized on the balanced manifold. This allows us to decompose the training dynamics into two distinct gradient flows: a regularizing flow on fibers and a learning flow on the balanced manifold. We show that the regularizing flow is exactly solvable using the moment map. This approach provides a common mathematical framework for balancedness in deep learning and linear systems theory. We use this framework to interpret balancedness in terms of model reduction and Bayesian principles.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Filtered Neural Galerkin model reduction schemes for efficient propagation of initial condition uncertainties in digital twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00670v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification in digital twins is critical to enable reliable and credible predictions beyond available data. A key challenge is that ensemble-based approaches can become prohibitively expensive when embedded in control and data assimilation loops in digital twins, even when reduced models are used. We introduce a reduced modeling approach that advances in time the mean and covariance of the reduced solution distribution induced by the initial condition uncertainties, which eliminates the need to maintain and propagate a costly ensemble of reduced solutions. The mean and covariance dynamics are obtained as a moment closure from Neural Galerkin schemes on pre-trained neural networks, which can be interpreted as filtered Neural Galerkin dynamics analogous to Gaussian filtering and the extended Kalman filter. Numerical experiments demonstrate that filtered Neural Galerkin schemes achieve more than one order of magnitude speedup compared to ensemble-based uncertainty propagation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Interpretable Deep Learning and Analysis of Dynamical Systems via the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21852v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18636v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.</p></details> | 10 pages, BMVC2025 |

In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16509v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Flash Thinking via Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15374v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |

However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The "space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06608v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</p></details> | 62 pages, 26 figures |

From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</p></details> |  |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |

These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, symbolic reasoning, and tool use, but reliably solving PDEs across heterogeneous settings remains challenging. Prior work on LLM-based code generation and transformer-based foundation models for PDE learning has shown promising advances. However, a persistent trade-off between execution success rate and numerical accuracy arises, particularly when generalization to unseen parameters and boundary conditions is required. In this work, we propose OpInf-LLM, an LLM parametric PDE solving framework based on operator inference. The proposed framework leverages a small amount of solution data to enable accurate prediction of diverse PDE instances, including unseen parameters and configurations, and provides seamless integration with LLMs for natural language specification of PDE solving tasks. Its low computational demands and unified tool interface further enable a high execution success rate across heterogeneous settings. By combining operator inference with LLM capabilities, OpInf-LLM opens new possibilities for generalizable reduced-order modeling in LLM-based PDE solving.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics.

| **[Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552v8)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To explore the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and to probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of emulators of multiscale systems to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) the choice of an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. These insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific goals, processes, and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application by developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. Overall, these results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory providing a principled framework to guide model design and enhance causal understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12814v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios, such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, three numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks can achieve comparable performance in input generalization and achieves superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios and ROM-based approaches for learning on time-dependent data.</p></details> |  |

Existing non-intrusive approaches approximate the dynamics of a reduced-order model (ROM) by solving a data-driven least-squares regression problem for low-dimensional matrix operators. Our approach instead leverages regularized kernel interpolation, which yields an optimal approximation of the ROM dynamics from a user-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that our kernel-based approach can produce interpretable ROMs whose structure mirrors full-order model structure by embedding judiciously chosen feature maps into the kernel. The approach is flexible and allows a combination of informed structure through feature maps and closure terms via more general nonlinear terms in the kernel. We also derive a computable a posteriori error bound that combines standard error estimates for intrusive projection-based ROMs and kernel interpolants. The approach is demonstrated in several numerical experiments that include comparisons to operator inference using both proper orthogonal decomposition and quadratic manifold dimension reduction.</p></details> |  |

The inherent locomotion constraints of bipedal robots challenge their safe maneuvering capabilities in dynamic environments. When combined with the intricacies of social environments, including pedestrian interactions and social cues, such as emotions, these challenges become even more pronounced. To address these coupled problems, we propose a two-stage pipeline that considers both bipedal locomotion constraints and complex social environments. Specifically, social navigation scenarios are represented using sequential LiDAR grid maps (LGMs), from which we extract latent features, including collision regions, emotion-related discomfort zones, social interactions, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of evolving environments. The extracted features are directly mapped to the actions of reduced-order models (ROMs) through a DRL architecture. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates full-order dynamics and locomotion constraints during training, effectively accounting for tracking errors and restrictions of the locomotion controller while planning the trajectory with ROMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach exceeds both model-based planners and DRL-based baselines. The hardware videos and open-source code are available at https://gatech-lidar.github.io/emobipednav.github.io/.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Data-driven stochastic reduced-order modeling of parametrized dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10690v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling complex dynamical systems under varying conditions is computationally intensive, often rendering high-fidelity simulations intractable. Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Learning of Interpretable Reduced-Order Models for Jumping Quadruped Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06538v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models are central to motion planning and control of quadruped robots, yet existing templates are often hand-crafted for a specific locomotion modality. This motivates the need for automatic methods that extract task-specific, interpretable low-dimensional dynamics directly from data. We propose a methodology that combines a linear autoencoder with symbolic regression to derive such models. The linear autoencoder provides a consistent latent embedding for configurations, velocities, accelerations, and inputs, enabling the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to operate in a compact, physics-aligned space. A multi-phase, hybrid-aware training scheme ensures coherent latent coordinates across contact transitions. We focus our validation on quadruped jumping-a representative, challenging, yet contained scenario in which a principled template model is especially valuable. The resulting symbolic dynamics outperform the state-of-the-art handcrafted actuated spring-loaded inverted pendulum (aSLIP) baseline in simulation and hardware across multiple robots and jumping modalities.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[An adjoint method for training data-driven reduced-order models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07579v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order modeling lies at the interface of numerical analysis and data-driven scientific computing, providing principled ways to compress high-fidelity simulations in science and engineering. We propose a training framework that couples a continuous-time form of operator inference with the adjoint-state method to obtain robust data-driven reduced-order models. This method minimizes a trajectory-based loss between reduced-order solutions and projected snapshot data, which removes the need to estimate time derivatives from noisy measurements and provides intrinsic temporal regularization through time integration. We derive the corresponding continuous adjoint equations to compute gradients efficiently and implement a gradient based optimizer to update the reduced model parameters. Each iteration only requires one forward reduced order solve and one adjoint solve, followed by inexpensive gradient assembly, making the method attractive for large-scale simulations. We validate the proposed method on three partial differential equations: viscous Burgers' equation, the two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation, and an advection-diffusion equation. We perform systematic comparisons against standard operator inference under two perturbation regimes, namely reduced temporal snapshot density and additive Gaussian noise. For clean data, both approaches deliver similar accuracy, but in situations with sparse sampling and noise, the proposed adjoint-based training provides better accuracy and enhanced roll-out stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparison of Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition Algorithms for Thermal-Hydraulics Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24205v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, algorithms aiming at learning models from available data have become quite popular due to two factors: 1) the significant developments in Artificial Intelligence techniques and 2) the availability of large amounts of data. Nevertheless, this topic has already been addressed by methodologies belonging to the Reduced Order Modelling framework, of which perhaps the most famous equation-free technique is Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This algorithm aims to learn the best linear model that represents the physical phenomena described by a time series dataset: its output is a best state operator of the underlying dynamical system that can be used, in principle, to advance the original dataset in time even beyond its span. However, in its standard formulation, this technique cannot deal with parametric time series, meaning that a different linear model has to be derived for each parameter realization. Research on this is ongoing, and some versions of a parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition already exist. This work contributes to this research field by comparing the different algorithms presently deployed and assessing their advantages and shortcomings compared to each other. To this aim, three different thermal-hydraulics problems are considered: two benchmark 'flow over cylinder' test cases at diverse Reynolds numbers, whose datasets are, respectively, obtained with the FEniCS finite element solver and retrieved from the CFDbench dataset, and the DYNASTY experimental facility operating at Politecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by internally heated fluids for Generation IV nuclear applications, whose dataset was generated using the RELAP5 nodal solver.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for pubblication in Nuclear Technology</p></details> |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid coupling with operator inference and the overlapping Schwarz alternating method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20687v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for coupling subdomain-local non-intrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) reduced order models (ROMs) with each other and with subdomain-local high-fidelity full order models (FOMs) with using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method (O-SAM). The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Policy Learning for Legged Robot with Simplified Model Pretraining and Model Homotopy Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24698v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating dynamic motions for legged robots remains a challenging problem. While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

| **[Active learning for data-driven reduced models of parametric differential systems with Bayesian operator inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00038v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work develops an active learning framework to intelligently enrich data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) of parametric dynamical systems, which can serve as the foundation of virtual assets in a digital twin. Data-driven ROMs are explainable, computationally efficient scientific machine learning models that aim to preserve the underlying physics of complex dynamical simulations. Since the quality of data-driven ROMs is sensitive to the quality of the limited training data, we seek to identify training parameters for which using the associated training data results in the best possible parametric ROM. Our approach uses the operator inference methodology, a regression-based strategy which can be tailored to particular parametric structure for a large class of problems. We establish a probabilistic version of parametric operator inference, casting the learning problem as a Bayesian linear regression. Prediction uncertainties stemming from the resulting probabilistic ROM solutions are used to design a sequential adaptive sampling scheme to select new training parameter vectors that promote ROM stability and accuracy globally in the parameter domain. We conduct numerical experiments for several nonlinear parametric systems of partial differential equations and compare the results to ROMs trained on random parameter samples. The results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive sampling strategy consistently yields more stable and accurate ROMs than random sampling does under the same computational budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[mLaSDI: Multi-stage latent space dynamics identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09207v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is essential across many scientific disciplines. However, high-fidelity solvers can be computationally prohibitive, motivating the development of reduced-order models (ROMs). Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was proposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the training data via an autoencoder and learns user-specified ordinary differential equations (ODEs), governing the latent dynamics, enabling rapid predictions for unseen parameters. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous problems, the autoencoder must simultaneously reconstruct the training data and satisfy the imposed latent dynamics, which are often competing objectives that limit accuracy, particularly for complex or high-frequency phenomena. To address this limitation, we propose multi-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, we train LaSDI sequentially in stages. After training the initial autoencoder, we train additional decoders which map the latent trajectories to residuals from previous stages. This staged residual learning, combined with periodic activation functions, enables recovery of high-frequency content without sacrificing interpretability of the latent dynamics. Numerical experiments on a multiscale oscillating system, unsteady wake flow, and the 1D-1V Vlasov equation demonstrate that mLaSDI achieves significantly lower reconstruction and prediction errors, often by an order of magnitude, while requiring less training time and reduced hyperparameter tuning compared to standard LaSDI.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reduced Order Modeling for Tsunami Forecasting with Bayesian Hierarchical Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19804v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Critical Assessment of Pattern Comparisons Between POD and Autoencoders in Intraventricular Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19376v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

It promises to drastically reduce expensive numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling. Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, SPIGM workshop at NeurIPS 2025, https://openreview.net/forum?id=IT9lF59UqG&noteId=IT9lF59UqG</p></details> |

Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.</p></details> |  |

Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.</p></details> | 38 pages, 14 figures |

In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Updating of constitutive parameters under hybrid uncertainties with a novel surrogate model applied to biofilms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15145v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of bacterial biofilm growth is essential for understanding their complex dynamics in biomedical, environmental, and industrial settings. These dynamics are shaped by a variety of environmental influences, including the presence of antibiotics, nutrient availability, and inter-species interactions, all of which affect species-specific growth rates. However, capturing this behavior in computational models is challenging due to the presence of hybrid uncertainties, a combination of epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete knowledge about model parameters) and aleatory uncertainty (reflecting inherent biological variability and stochastic environmental conditions). In this work, we present a Bayesian model updating (BMU) framework to calibrate a recently introduced multi-species biofilm growth model. To enable efficient inference in the presence of hybrid uncertainties, we construct a reduced-order model (ROM) derived using the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) approach. TSM allows for an efficient propagation of aleatory uncertainty, which enables single-loop Bayesian inference, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive nested (double-loop) schemes typically required in hybrid uncertainty quantification. The BMU framework employs a likelihood function constructed from the mean and variance of stochastic model outputs, enabling robust parameter calibration even under sparse and noisy data. We validate our approach through two case studies: a two-species and a four-species biofilm model. Both demonstrate that our method not only accurately recovers the underlying model parameters but also provides predictive responses consistent with the synthetic data.</p></details> |  |

Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Accuracy and Speed: A Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter with a Machine Learning Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12276v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, more and more machine learning (ML) surrogates are being developed for computationally expensive physical models. In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Extrapolation with Graph Convolutional Autoencoder and Tensor Train Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23037v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph autoencoders have gained attention in nonlinear reduced-order modeling of parameterized partial differential equations defined on unstructured grids. Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operator Learning at Machine Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19980v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.</p></details> |  |

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by Applied Energy</p></details> |

This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward.</p></details> |  |

We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. We argue, that a critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states in parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.</p></details> | 28 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Equilibrium Propagation for Non-Conservative Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03670v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a physics-inspired learning algorithm that uses stationary states of a dynamical system both for inference and learning. In its original formulation it is limited to conservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ to dynamics which derive from an energy function. Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (9 pages main text), 7 figures</p></details> |

We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce a specific irrational frequency separation ($π$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal (semantic) and noise (syntactic) subspaces. We show empirical evidence that these geometric inductive biases can induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints and structural artifacts. To provide a theoretical grounding for these spectral phenomena, we draw an analogy between attention mechanism and a Hamiltonian dynamical system and identify that the standard geometric progression of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) induces dense resonance networks (Arnold Tongues), leading to feature rank collapse. Empirical validation on 124M-parameter models trained on OpenWebText demonstrates that Prism spontaneously isolates the Attention Sink pathology and maintains isentropic information flow across layers. Further, we suggest a physics-informed plug-and-play intervention KAM-RoPE for large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance can be unified through principled geometric construction, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to heuristic architectural modifications</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Hyper-Compression: Model Compression via Hyperfunction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00592v4)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of large models' size has far outpaced that of computing resources. To bridge this gap, encouraged by the parsimonious relationship between genotype and phenotype in the brain's growth and development, we propose the so-called Hyper-Compression that turns the model compression into the issue of parameter representation via a hyperfunction. Specifically, it is known that the trajectory of some low-dimensional dynamic systems can fill the high-dimensional space eventually. Thus, Hyper-Compression, using these dynamic systems as the hyperfunctions, represents the parameters of the target network by their corresponding composition number or trajectory length. This suggests a novel mechanism for model compression, substantially different from the existing pruning, quantization, distillation, and decomposition. Along this direction, we methodologically identify a suitable dynamic system with the irrational winding as the hyperfunction and theoretically derive its associated error bound. Next, guided by our theoretical insights, we propose several engineering twists to make the Hyper-Compression pragmatic and effective. Lastly, systematic and comprehensive experiments on \textcolor{black}{NLP models such as LLaMA and Qwen series and vision models} confirm that Hyper-Compression enjoys the following \textbf{PNAS} merits: 1) \textbf{P}referable compression ratio; 2) \textbf{N}o post-hoc retraining; 3) \textbf{A}ffordable inference time; and 4) \textbf{S}hort compression time. It compresses LLaMA2-7B in an hour and achieves close-to-int4-quantization performance, without retraining and with a performance drop of less than 1\%.

| **[Inferring stochastic dynamics with growth from cross-sectional data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13197v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-resolved single-cell omics data offers high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of cellular states, which are instrumental to reverse-engineer the processes underpinning cell fate. Such technologies are inherently destructive, allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach, unbalanced probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step training scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning non-equilibrium diffusions with Schrödinger bridges: from exactly solvable to simulation-free](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16644v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the Schrödinger bridge problem which, given ensemble measurements of the initial and final configurations of a stochastic dynamical system and some prior knowledge on the dynamics, aims to reconstruct the "most likely" evolution of the system compatible with the data. Most existing literature assume Brownian reference dynamics, and are implicitly limited to modelling systems driven by the gradient of a potential energy. We depart from this regime and consider reference processes described by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with generic drift matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$. When $\mathbf{A}$ is asymmetric, this corresponds to a non-equilibrium system in which non-gradient forces are at play: this is important for applications to biological systems, which naturally exist out-of-equilibrium. In the case of Gaussian marginals, we derive explicit expressions that characterise exactly the solution of both the static and dynamic Schrödinger bridge. For general marginals, we propose mvOU-OTFM, a simulation-free algorithm based on flow and score matching for learning an approximation to the Schrödinger bridge. In application to a range of problems based on synthetic and real single cell data, we demonstrate that mvOU-OTFM achieves higher accuracy compared to competing methods, whilst being significantly faster to train.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We propose a unified class of geometry-aware architectures that interleave geometric updates between layers, where both projection layers and intrinsic exponential map updates arise as discretizations of projected dynamical systems on manifolds (with or without boundary). Within this framework, we establish universal approximation results for constrained neural ODEs. We also analyze architectures that enforce geometry only at the output, proving a separate universal approximation property that enables direct comparison to interleaved designs. When the constraint set is unknown, we learn projections via small-time heat-kernel limits, showing diffusion/flow-matching can be used as data-based projections. Experiments on dynamics over S^2 and SO(3), and diffusion on S^{d-1}-valued features demonstrate exact feasibility for analytic updates and strong performance for learned projections</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the search space of the dynamic graphs is combinatorial in nature. In this study, we propose \textit{Stable Causal Dynamic Differentiable Discovery (SC3D)}, a two-stage differentiable framework that jointly learns lag-specific adjacency matrices and, if present, an instantaneous directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Stage 1, SC3D performs edge preselection through node-wise prediction to obtain masks for lagged and instantaneous edges, whereas Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing a likelihood with sparsity along with enforcing acyclicity on the instantaneous block. Numerical results across synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate that SC3D achieves improved stability and more accurate recovery of both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing temporal baselines.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Backpropagation as Physical Relaxation: Exact Gradients in Finite Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02281v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backpropagation, the foundational algorithm for training neural networks, is typically understood as a symbolic computation that recursively applies the chain rule. We show it emerges exactly as the finite-time relaxation of a physical dynamical system. By formulating feedforward inference as a continuous-time process and applying Lagrangian theory of non-conservative systems to handle asymmetric interactions, we derive a global energy functional on a doubled state space encoding both activations and sensitivities. The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Training-free score-based diffusion for parameter-dependent stochastic dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02113v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating parameter-dependent stochastic differential equations (SDEs) presents significant computational challenges, as separate high-fidelity simulations are typically required for each parameter value of interest. Despite the success of machine learning methods in learning SDE dynamics, existing approaches either require expensive neural network training for score function estimation or lack the ability to handle continuous parameter dependence. We present a training-free conditional diffusion model framework for learning stochastic flow maps of parameter-dependent SDEs, where both drift and diffusion coefficients depend on physical parameters. The key technical innovation is a joint kernel-weighted Monte Carlo estimator that approximates the conditional score function using trajectory data sampled at discrete parameter values, enabling interpolation across both state space and the continuous parameter domain. Once trained, the resulting generative model produces sample trajectories for any parameter value within the training range without retraining, significantly accelerating parameter studies, uncertainty quantification, and real-time filtering applications. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three numerical examples of increasing complexity, showing accurate approximation of conditional distributions across varying parameter values.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic function-on-function nonlinear autoregressive model for emulation and reliability analysis of dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01929v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing accurate and computationally efficient surrogate models (or emulators) for predicting dynamical system responses is critical in many engineering domains, yet remains challenging due to the strongly nonlinear and high-dimensional mapping from external excitations and system parameters to system responses. This work introduces a novel Function-on-Function Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs (F2NARX), which reformulates the conventional NARX model from a function-on-function regression perspective, inspired by the recently proposed $\mathcal{F}$-NARX method. The proposed framework substantially improves predictive efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. By combining principal component analysis with Gaussian process regression, F2NARX further enables probabilistic predictions of dynamical responses via the unscented transform in an autoregressive manner. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through case studies of varying complexity. Results show that F2NARX outperforms state-of-the-art NARX model by orders of magnitude in efficiency while achieving higher accuracy in general. Moreover, its probabilistic prediction capabilities facilitate active learning, enabling accurate estimation of first-passage failure probabilities of dynamical systems using only a small number of training time histories.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods require known physical properties as supervision or inputs, limiting their applicability under unknown conditions. To explore this challenge, we introduce Cloth Dynamics Grounding (CDG), a novel scenario for unsupervised learning of cloth dynamics from multi-view visual observations. We further propose Cloth Dynamics Splatting (CloDS), an unsupervised dynamic learning framework designed for CDG. CloDS adopts a three-stage pipeline that first performs video-to-geometry grounding and then trains a dynamics model on the grounded meshes. To cope with large non-linear deformations and severe self-occlusions during grounding, we introduce a dual-position opacity modulation that supports bidirectional mapping between 2D observations and 3D geometry via mesh-based Gaussian splatting in video-to-geometry grounding stage. It jointly considers the absolute and relative position of Gaussian components. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CloDS effectively learns cloth dynamics from visual data while maintaining strong generalization capabilities for unseen configurations.

| **[Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with library optimization mechanism: Recursive long-term prediction perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18220v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized. The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term (RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The dynamical model obtained by SINDy-LOM has good interpretability and usability, as this approach yields a parsimonious closed-form model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11365958)</p></details> |

| **[Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformers for Operator Learning of Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01486v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a surge in data-driven surrogates for dynamical systems that can be orders of magnitude faster than numerical solvers. However, many machine learning-based models such as neural operators exhibit spectral bias, attenuating high-frequency components that often encode small-scale structure. This limitation is particularly damaging in applications such as weather forecasting, where misrepresented high frequencies can induce long-horizon instability. To address this issue, we propose multi-scale wavelet transformers (MSWTs), which learn system dynamics in a tokenized wavelet domain. The wavelet transform explicitly separates low- and high-frequency content across scales. MSWTs leverage a wavelet-preserving downsampling scheme that retains high-frequency features and employ wavelet-based attention to capture dependencies across scales and frequency bands. Experiments on chaotic dynamical systems show substantial error reductions and improved long horizon spectral fidelity. On the ERA5 climate reanalysis, MSWTs further reduce climatological bias, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world forecasting setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v7)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using benchmark chaotic dynamical systems, we empirically show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM using a handful of different measurement systems, against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, under review in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

Their abilities to maintain internal memory and adapt quickly to unseen scenarios have offered them unparalleled performance when compared to non-recurrent counterparts. However, until today, the underlying mechanisms for their superior generalization and robustness performance remain poorly understood. In this study, by analyzing the hidden state domain of recurrent policies learned over a diverse set of training methods, model architectures, and tasks, we find that stable cyclic structures consistently emerge during interaction with the environment. Such cyclic structures share a remarkable similarity with \textit{limit cycles} in dynamical system analysis, if we consider the policy and the environment as a joint hybrid dynamical system. Moreover, we uncover that the geometry of such limit cycles also has a structured correspondence with the policies' behaviors. These findings offer new perspectives to explain many nice properties of recurrent policies: the emergence of limit cycles stabilizes both the policies' internal memory and the task-relevant environmental states, while suppressing nuisance variability arising from environmental uncertainty; the geometry of limit cycles also encodes relational structures of behaviors, facilitating easier skill adaptation when facing non-stationary environments.</p></details> |  |

We introduce four learnable Koopman variants-scalar-gated, per-mode gated, MLP-shaped spectral mapping, and low-rank Koopman operators which generalize and interpolate between strictly stable Koopman operators and unconstrained linear latent dynamics. Our formulation enables explicit control over the spectrum, stability, and rank of the linear transition operator while retaining compatibility with expressive nonlinear backbones such as Patchtst, Autoformer, and Informer. We evaluate the proposed operators in a large-scale benchmark that also includes LSTM, DLinear, and simple diagonal State-Space Models (SSMs), as well as lightweight transformer variants. Experiments across multiple horizons and patch lengths show that learnable Koopman models provide a favorable bias-variance trade-off, improved conditioning, and more interpretable latent dynamics. We provide a full spectral analysis, including eigenvalue trajectories, stability envelopes, and learned spectral distributions. Our results demonstrate that learnable Koopman operators are effective, stable, and theoretically principled components for deep forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, CFM is insufficient to ensure accuracy in learning probability paths. In this paper, we introduce a new partial differential equation characterization for the error between the learned and exact probability paths, along with its solution. We show that the total variation gap between the two probability paths is bounded above by a combination of the CFM loss and an associated divergence loss. This theoretical insight leads to the design of a new objective function that simultaneously matches the flow and its divergence. Our new approach improves the performance of the flow-based generative model by a noticeable margin without sacrificing generation efficiency. We showcase the advantages of this enhanced training approach over CFM on several important benchmark tasks, including generative modeling for dynamical systems, DNA sequences, and videos.

Interventions in dynamic systems alter not only outcome levels but also evolutionary dynamics -- changing persistence and transition laws. Our framework treats potential outcomes as entire trajectories, enabling causal estimands, identification conditions, and estimators to be formulated directly on path space. The resulting Dynamic Average Treatment Effect (DATE) characterizes how causal effects evolve through time and reduces to the classical average treatment effect under one period of time. For observational data, we derive a dynamic inverse-probability weighting estimator that is unbiased under dynamic ignorability and positivity. When treated units are scarce, we show that conditional mean trajectories underlying the DATE admit a linear state-space representation, yielding a dynamic linear model implementation. Simulations demonstrate that modeling time as intrinsic to the causal mechanism exposes dynamic effects that static methods systematically misestimate. An empirical study of COVID-19 lockdowns illustrates the framework's practical value for estimating and decomposing treatment effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[True Zero-Shot Inference of Dynamical Systems Preserving Long-Term Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13192v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</p></details> |  |

However, most RL algorithms rely on the Markov Decision Process assumption, which is violated in practical cyber-physical systems affected by sensing delays, actuation latencies, and communication constraints. Such time delays introduce memory effects that can significantly degrade performance and compromise stability, particularly in networked and multi-agent environments. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL methods designed to address time delays in control systems. We first formalize the main classes of delays and analyze their impact on the Markov property. We then systematically categorize existing approaches into five major families: state augmentation and history-based representations, recurrent policies with learned memory, predictor-based and model-aware methods, robust and domain-randomized training strategies, and safe RL frameworks with explicit constraint handling. For each family, we discuss underlying principles, practical advantages, and inherent limitations. A comparative analysis highlights key trade-offs among these approaches and provides practical guidelines for selecting suitable methods under different delay characteristics and safety requirements. Finally, we identify open challenges and promising research directions, including stability certification, large-delay learning, multi-agent communication co-design, and standardized benchmarking. This survey aims to serve as a unified reference for researchers and practitioners developing reliable RL-based controllers in delay-affected cyber-physical systems.</p></details> | 30 pages |

For the unconstrained problem, we establish the ZO algorithm's convergence to a global minimum along with its complexity when applied to both QC and SQC functions. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained case. Specifically, we derive complexity bounds and prove convergence of the algorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme. Beyond the theoretical guarantees, we demonstrate the practical implications of our results on several machine learning problems where quasar-convexity naturally arises, including linear dynamical system identification and generalised linear models.</p></details> |  |

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The method learns a shared, node-wise update rule that maps local interaction fields to spin updates, parameterized by a compact multilayer perceptron with a small number of parameters. Training is performed using a zeroth-order optimizer, since backpropagation through long, recurrent Ising-machine dynamics leads to unstable and poorly informative gradients. We call this approach a neural network parameterized Ising machine (NPIM). Despite its low parameter count, the learned dynamics recover effective algorithmic structure, including momentum-like behavior and time-varying schedules, enabling efficient search in highly non-convex energy landscapes. Across standard Ising and neural combinatorial optimization benchmarks, NPIM achieves competitive solution quality and time-to-solution relative to recent learning-based methods and strong classical Ising-machine heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[SplineFlow: Flow Matching for Dynamical Systems with B-Spline Interpolants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23072v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching is a scalable generative framework for characterizing continuous normalizing flows with wide-range applications. However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since naïve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

| **[Wasserstein Geometry of Information Loss in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22814v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-delay embedding is a powerful technique for reconstructing the state space of nonlinear time series. However, the fidelity of reconstruction relies on the assumption that the time-delay map is an embedding, which is implicitly justified by Takens' embedding theorem but rarely scrutinised in practice. In this work, we argue that time-delay reconstruction is not always an embedding, and that the non-injectivity of the time-delay map induced by a given measurement function causes irreducible information loss, degrading downstream model performance. Our analysis reveals that this local self-overlap stems from inherent dynamical properties, governed by the competition between the dynamical and the curvature penalty, and the irreducible information loss scales with the product of the geometric separation and the probability mass. We establish a measure-theoretic framework that lifts the dynamics to the space of probability measures, where the multi-valued evolution induced by the non-injectivity is quantified by how far the $n$-step conditional kernel $K^{n}(x, \cdot)$ deviates from a Dirac mass and introduce intrinsic stochasticity $\mathcal{E}^{*}_{n}$, an almost-everywhere, data-driven certificate of deterministic closure, to quantify irreducible information loss without any prior information. We demonstrate that $\mathcal{E}^{*}_{n}$ improves reconstruction quality and downstream model performance on both synthetic and real-world nonlinear data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10350v5)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iterative LLM systems(self-refinement, chain-of-thought, autonomous agents) are increasingly deployed, yet their temporal dynamics remain uncharacterized. Prior work evaluates task performance at convergence but ignores the trajectory: how does semantic content evolve across iterations? Does it stabilize, drift, or oscillate? Without answering these questions, we cannot predict system behavior, guarantee stability, or systematically design iterative architectures. We formalize agentic loops as discrete dynamical systems in semantic space. Borrowing from dynamical systems theory, we define trajectories, attractors and dynamical regimes for recursive LLM transformations, providing rigorous geometric definitions adapted to this setting. Our framework reveals that agentic loops exhibit classifiable dynamics: contractive (convergence toward stable semantic attractors), oscillatory (cycling among attractors), or exploratory (unbounded divergence). Experiments on singular loops validate the framework. Iterative paraphrasing produces contractive dynamics with measurable attractor formation and decreasing dispersion. Iterative negation produces exploratory dynamics with no stable structure. Crucially, prompt design directly controls the dynamical regime - the same model exhibits fundamentally different geometric behaviors depending solely on the transformation applied. This work establishes that iterative LLM dynamics are predictable and controllable, opening new directions for stability analysis, trajectory forecasting, and principled design of composite loops that balance convergence and exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Graph Pattern Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22454v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph learning is pivotal for deciphering dynamic systems, where the core challenge lies in explicitly modeling the underlying evolving patterns that govern network transformation. However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Filtering for Learning Quantum Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22400v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning high-dimensional quantum systems is a fundamental challenge that notoriously suffers from the curse of dimensionality. We formulate the task of predicting quantum evolution in the linear response regime as a specific instance of learning a Complex-Valued Linear Dynamical System (CLDS) with sector-bounded eigenvalues -- a setting that also encompasses modern Structured State Space Models (SSMs). While traditional system identification attempts to reconstruct full system matrices (incurring exponential cost in the Hilbert dimension), we propose Quantum Spectral Filtering, a method that shifts the goal to improper dynamic learning. Leveraging the optimal concentration properties of the Slepian basis, we prove that the learnability of such systems is governed strictly by an effective quantum dimension $k^*$, determined by the spectral bandwidth and memory horizon. This result establishes that complex-valued LDSs can be learned with sample and computational complexity independent of the ambient state dimension, provided their spectrum is bounded.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15982v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) was recently proposed for state estimation in dynamical systems when only a sparse subset of the state variables can be observed. The S-DEIM estimate involves a kernel vector whose optimal value is inferred through a data assimilation algorithm. This data assimilation step suffers from two drawbacks: (i) It requires the knowledge of the governing equations of the dynamical system, and (ii) It is not generally guaranteed to converge to the optimal kernel vector. To address these issues, here we introduce an equation-free S-DEIM framework that estimates the optimal kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We show that the recurrent architecture is necessary since the kernel vector cannot be estimated from instantaneous observations. But RNNs, which incorporate the past history of the observations in the learning process, lead to nearly optimal estimations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on three numerical examples with increasing degree of spatiotemporal complexity: a conceptual model of atmospheric flow known as the Lorenz-96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Rayleigh-Benard convection. In each case, the resulting S-DEIM estimates are satisfactory even when a relatively simple RNN architecture, namely the reservoir computing network, is used. More specifically, our RNN-based S-DEIM state estimations reduce the relative error between 42% and 58% when compared to Q-DEIM which ignores the kernel vector by setting it equal to zero.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Proc.

We introduce MAAT (Model Aware Approximation of Trajectories), a framework for symbolic discovery built on knowledge-informed Kernel State Reconstruction. MAAT formulates state reconstruction in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and directly incorporates structural and semantic priors such as non-negativity, conservation laws, and domain-specific observation models into the reconstruction objective, while accommodating heterogeneous sampling and measurement granularity. This yields smooth, physically consistent state estimates with analytic time derivatives, providing a principled interface between fragmented sensor data and symbolic regression. Across twelve diverse scientific benchmarks and multiple noise regimes, MAAT substantially reduces state-estimation MSE for trajectories and derivatives used by downstream symbolic regression relative to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizer: A Unified Framework for Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22284v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs), a family of optimization algorithms that unifies classic optimizers within one geometric framework. Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold. This perspective yields a constructive ``optimizer generator" that not only recovers classic algorithms but enables the principled design of RLOs. We validate our theory via geometric diagnostics and demonstrate that grounding optimizer design in control theory yields state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks. Overall, RLOs bridge control theory and modern machine learning optimization, providing a unified language and a systematic toolkit for designing stable, effective optimizers.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/standardmodelbio/SMB-v1-1.7B-Structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Information Gathering Under Dynamics Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21988v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Bayesian Experimental Design for Partially Observed Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04403v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled framework for optimizing data collection by choosing experiments that are maximally informative about unknown parameters. However, existing methods cannot deal with the joint challenge of (a) partially observable dynamical systems, where only noisy and incomplete observations are available, and (b) fully online inference, which updates posterior distributions and selects designs sequentially in a computationally efficient manner. Under partial observability, dynamical systems are naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) -- intractable. We address these challenges by deriving new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our approach leverages nested particle filters for efficient online state-parameter inference with convergence guarantees. Applications to realistic models, such as the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and a moving source location task, show that our framework successfully handles both partial observability and online inference.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Pathwise Learning of Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Partial Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21860v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction and inference of stochastic dynamical systems from data is a fundamental task in inverse problems and statistical learning. While surrogate modeling advances computational methods to approximate these dynamics, standard approaches typically require high-fidelity training data. In many practical settings, the data are indirectly observed through noisy and nonlinear measurement. The challenge lies not only in approximating the coefficients of the SDEs, but in simultaneously inferring the posterior updates given the observations. In this work, we present a neural path estimation approach to solve stochastic dynamical systems based on variational inference. We first derive a stochastic control problem that solve filtering posterior path measure corresponding to a pathwise Zakai equation. We then construct a generative model that maps the prior path measure to posterior measure through the controlled diffusion and the associated Randon-Nykodym derivative. Through an amortization of sample paths of the observation process, the control is learned by an embedding of the noisy observation paths. Thus, we learn the unknown prior SDE and the control can recover the conditional path measure given the observation sample paths and we learn an associated SDE which induces the same path measure. In the end, we perform experiments on nonlinear dynamical systems, demonstrating the model's ability to learn multimodal, chaotic, or high dimensional systems.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we analyze the effect of the excitation input on the sample complexity of identifying the true system with high probability. To this end, we present sample complexity lower bounds that capture the choice of the selected excitation input. The sample complexity lower bound gives rise to a system theoretic condition to determine the potential benefit of experiment design. Informed by the analysis of the sample complexity lower bound, we propose a persistent excitation (PE) condition tailored to the considered setting, which we then use to establish sample complexity upper bounds. Notably, the PE condition is weaker than in the case of an infinite hypothesis class and allows analyzing different excitation inputs modularly. Crucially, the lower and upper bounds share the same dependency on key problem parameters. Finally, we leverage these insights to propose an active learning algorithm that sequentially excites the system optimally with respect to the current estimate, and provide sample complexity guarantees for the presented algorithm. Concluding simulations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for spotlight presentation at AISTATS 2026</p></details> |

The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples.</p></details> | 31 pages, 2 figures |

Unlike classical filters, which rely on explicit knowledge of system dynamics and noise models, neural estimators can be trained purely from data without access to the underlying system equations. In this work, we present a systematic empirical comparison between such model-free neural network models and classical filtering methods across multiple nonlinear scenarios. Our study evaluates Transformer-based models, state-space neural networks, and recurrent architectures alongside particle filters and nonlinear Kalman filters. The results show that neural models (in particular, state-space models (SSMs)) achieve state estimation performance that approaches strong nonlinear Kalman filters in nonlinear scenarios and outperform weaker classical baselines despite lacking access to system models, while also attaining substantially higher inference throughput.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \emph{sparse observations} and \emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.</p></details> |  |

The high-dimensional characteristics and hidden critical signals further complicate early-warning tasks. This study proposes a novel early-warning framework that integrates manifold learning with stochastic dynamical system modeling. Through systematic comparison, six methods including diffusion maps (DM) are selected to construct low-dimensional representations. Based on these, a data-driven stochastic differential equation model is established to robustly estimate the probability evolution scoring function of the system. Building on this, a new Score Function (SF) indicator is defined by incorporating Schrödinger bridge theory to quantify the likelihood of significant state transitions in the system. Experiments demonstrate that this indicator exhibits higher sensitivity and robustness in epilepsy prediction, enables earlier identification of critical points, and clearly captures dynamic features across various stages before and after seizure onset. This work provides a systematic theoretical framework and practical methodology for extracting early-warning signals from high-dimensional data.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation. While this last finding highlights an area for future work, our results suggest that using NODEs to enrich limited data and enable symbolic regression to infer physical laws represents a promising new approach for scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, many existing approaches rely on accurate derivative estimation and are limited to first-order dynamical systems, restricting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Sparse Equation Matching (SEM), a unified framework that encompasses several existing equation discovery methods under a common formulation. SEM introduces an integral-based sparse regression approach using Green's functions, enabling derivative-free estimation of differential operators and their associated driving functions in general-order dynamical systems. The effectiveness of SEM is demonstrated through extensive simulations, benchmarking its performance against derivative-based approaches. We then apply SEM to electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during multiple oculomotor tasks, collected from 52 participants in a brain-computer interface experiment. Our method identifies active brain regions across participants and reveals task-specific connectivity patterns. These findings offer valuable insights into brain connectivity and the underlying neural mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Building on this insight, we propose a universal preconditioning method that convolves the target with coefficients from orthogonal polynomials such as Chebyshev or Legendre. We prove that this approach reduces regret for two distinct prediction algorithms and yields the first ever sublinear and hidden-dimension-independent regret bounds (up to logarithmic factors) that hold for systems with marginally table and asymmetric transition matrices. Finally, extensive synthetic and real-world experiments show that this simple preconditioning strategy improves the performance of a diverse range of algorithms, including recurrent neural networks, and generalizes to signals beyond linear dynamical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 3 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Online Learning of Deep Koopman Linear Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12760v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Conformal Online Learning of Koopman embeddings (COLoKe), a novel framework for adaptively updating Koopman-invariant representations of nonlinear dynamical systems from streaming data. Our modeling approach combines deep feature learning with multistep prediction consistency in the lifted space, where the dynamics evolve linearly. To prevent overfitting, COLoKe employs a conformal-style mechanism that shifts the focus from evaluating the conformity of new states to assessing the consistency of the current Koopman model. Updates are triggered only when the current model's prediction error exceeds a dynamically calibrated threshold, allowing selective refinement of the Koopman operator and embedding. Empirical results on benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate the effectiveness of COLoKe in maintaining long-term predictive accuracy while significantly reducing unnecessary updates and avoiding overfitting.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Deep Neural Networks as Iterated Function Systems and a Generalization Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19958v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks, yet their mathematical analysis remains fragmented: stability and generalization are typically studied in disparate frameworks and on a case-by-case basis. Architecturally, DNNs rely on the recursive application of parametrized functions, a mechanism that can be unstable and difficult to train, making stability a primary concern. Even when training succeeds, there are few rigorous results on how well such models generalize beyond the observed data, especially in the generative setting. In this work, we leverage the theory of stochastic Iterated Function Systems (IFS) and show that two important deep architectures can be viewed as, or canonically associated with, place-dependent IFS. This connection allows us to import results from random dynamical systems to (i) establish the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures under suitable contractivity assumptions, and (ii) derive a Wasserstein generalization bound for generative modeling. The bound naturally leads to a new training objective that directly controls the collage-type approximation error between the data distribution and its image under the learned transfer operator. We illustrate the theory on a controlled 2D example and empirically evaluate the proposed objective on standard image datasets (MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10).</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we establish nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas, rigorously generalizing the classical Kramers-Moyal relations to SDEs with multiplicative Lévy noise. These formulas provide a direct link between short-time transition probability densities (or sample path statistics) and the underlying SDE coefficients: the drift vector, diffusion matrix, Lévy jump measure kernel, and Lévy noise intensity functions. Leveraging these theoretical foundations, we develop novel data-driven algorithms capable of simultaneously identifying all governing components from data and establish convergence results and error analysis for the algorithms. We validate the framework through extensive numerical experiments on prototypical systems. This work provides a principled and practical toolbox for discovering interpretable SDE models governing complex systems influenced by discontinuous, heavy-tailed, state-dependent fluctuations, with broad applicability in climate science, neuroscience, epidemiology, finance, and biological physics.</p></details> |  |

The method introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto τ(t)$ that regularizes near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization operator that can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow architectures used in AI systems.

| **[A Unifying View of Coverage in Linear Off-Policy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19030v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature. We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Recent empirical work has documented topology-preserving latent organization in trained recurrent models, and recent theoretical results in reservoir computing establish conditions under which the synchronization map is an embedding. Here we synthesize these threads into a unified account of when contracting recurrent networks yield smooth, topology-preserving internal representations for a broad and biologically relevant class of inputs: regular dynamics on invariant circles and tori. Our contribution is an integrated framework that assembles (i) generalized synchronization and embedding guarantees for contracting reservoirs, (ii) regularity mechanisms ensuring differentiability of the synchronization map under mild constraints, and (iii) a base-system viewpoint in which the invariant manifold generating the input stream is treated as the driving system. In this regular setting, the conditions commonly viewed as restrictive in chaotic-attractor analyses become mild and readily satisfied by standard contractive architectures. The framework clarifies how representational content in recurrent circuits is inherently historical: the network state encodes finite windows of input history rather than instantaneous stimuli. By consolidating disparate empirical and theoretical results under common assumptions, the synthesis yields concrete, testable expectations about when prediction-trained recurrent circuits should (or should not) form smooth latent embeddings and how required state dimension scales with the intrinsic dimension of the driving dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neural Cellular Automata: From Cells to Pixels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22899v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired dynamical systems in which identical cells iteratively apply a learned local update rule to self-organize into complex patterns, exhibiting regeneration, robustness, and spontaneous dynamics. Despite their success in texture synthesis and morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution outputs. This limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information that impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this limitation by pairing an NCA that evolves on a coarse grid with a lightweight implicit decoder that maps cell states and local coordinates to appearance attributes, enabling the same model to render outputs at arbitrary resolution. Moreover, because both the decoder and NCA updates are local, inference remains highly parallelizable. To supervise high-resolution outputs efficiently, we introduce task-specific losses for morphogenesis (growth from a seed) and texture synthesis with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our experiments across 2D/3D grids and mesh domains demonstrate that our hybrid models produce high-resolution outputs in real-time, and preserve the characteristic self-organizing behavior of NCAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 14 figures, +7 pages of Appendix</p></details> |
| **[A Computationally Efficient Maximum A Posteriori Sequence Estimation via Stein Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08684v4)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation in robotic systems presents significant challenges, particularly due to the prevalence of multimodal posterior distributions in real-world scenarios. One effective strategy for handling such complexity is to compute maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequences over a discretized or sampled state space, which enables a concise representation of the most likely state trajectory. However, this approach often incurs substantial computational costs, especially in high-dimensional settings. In this article, we propose a novel MAP sequence estimation method, Stein-MAP-Seq, which effectively addresses multimodality while substantially reducing computational and memory overhead. Our key contribution is a sequential variational inference framework that captures temporal dependencies in dynamical system models and integrates Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) into a Viterbi-style dynamic programming algorithm, enabling computationally efficient MAP sequence estimation. This integration allows the method to focus computational effort on MAP-consistent modes rather than exhaustively exploring the entire state space. Stein-MAP-Seq inherits the parallelism and mode-seeking behavior of SVGD, allowing particle updates to be efficiently executed on parallel hardware and significantly reducing the number of trajectory candidates required for MAP-sequence recursion compared to conventional methods that rely on hundreds to thousands of particles. We validate the proposed approach on a range of highly multimodal scenarios, including nonlinear dynamics with ambiguous observations, unknown data association with outliers, range-only localization under temporary unobservability, and high-dimensional robotic manipulators. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in estimation accuracy and robustness to multimodality over existing estimation methods.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS): A Unified Spectral Topology Framework for Stability in Turbulence, AI, and Biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11594v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional "Zero-Mode Attractor" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator - Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) - functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations: (1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity. Crucially, we verify that the operator remains dormant ($γ\approx 0$) during the linear growth phase of physical instabilities, functioning strictly as a conditional topological clamp. (2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($σ^2 \equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inclu...</summary><p>Includes supplementary materials and code.

| **[Enhancing Imbalanced Node Classification via Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03808v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imbalanced node classification in graph neural networks (GNNs) happens when some labels are much more common than others, which causes the model to learn unfairly and perform badly on the less common classes. To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods. The model's step-by-step method works well with different types of graph datasets, showing quicker results than training everything at once, better performance on new, imbalanced graphs, and clear explanations of each step using gradient stability and attention correlation learning curves. This work provides both a theoretically grounded framework for curriculum learning in GNNs and practical evidence of its effectiveness against imbalances, validated through metrics, convergence speeds, and generalisation tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Graph Filters via Adaptive Spectral Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03698v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Adaptive Spectral Shaping, a data-driven framework for graph filtering that learns a reusable baseline spectral kernel and modulates it with a small set of Gaussian factors. The resulting multi-peak, multi-scale responses allocate energy to heterogeneous regions of the Laplacian spectrum while remaining interpretable via explicit centers and bandwidths. To scale, we implement filters with Chebyshev polynomial expansions, avoiding eigendecompositions. We further propose Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS): the baseline kernel is learned on source graphs and, on a target graph, kept fixed while only the shaping parameters are adapted, enabling few-shot transfer under matched compute. Across controlled synthetic benchmarks spanning graph families and signal regimes, Adaptive Spectral Shaping reduces reconstruction error relative to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks, and TASS yields consistent positive transfer. The framework provides compact spectral modules that plug into graph signal processing pipelines and graph neural networks, combining scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acceleration of Atomistic NEGF: Algorithms, Parallelization, and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03438v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a particularly powerful method to simulate the quantum transport properties of nanoscale devices such as transistors, photo-diodes, or memory cells, in the ballistic limit of transport or in the presence of various scattering sources such as electronphonon, electron-photon, or even electron-electron interactions. The inclusion of all these mechanisms has been first demonstrated in small systems, composed of a few atoms, before being scaled up to larger structures made of thousands of atoms. Also, the accuracy of the models has kept improving, from empirical to fully ab-initio ones, e.g., density functional theory (DFT). This paper summarizes key (algorithmic) achievements that have allowed us to bring DFT+NEGF simulations closer to the dimensions and functionality of realistic systems. The possibility of leveraging graph neural networks and machine learning to speed up ab-initio device simulations is discussed as well.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPGCL: Simple yet Powerful Graph Contrastive Learning via SVD-Guided Structural Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00064v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are sensitive to structural noise from adversarial attacks or imperfections. Existing graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods typically rely on either random perturbations (e.g., edge dropping) for diversity or spectral augmentations (e.g., SVD) to preserve structural priors. However, random perturbations are structure-agnostic and may remove critical edges, while SVD-based views often lack sufficient diversity. Integrating these paradigms is challenging as they operate on discrete edge removal and continuous matrix factorization, respectively.We propose SPGCL, a framework for robust GCL via SVD-guided structural perturbation. Leveraging a recently developed SVD-based method that generalizes structural perturbation theory to arbitrary graphs, we design a two-stage strategy: (1) lightweight stochastic edge removal to inject diversity, and (2) truncated SVD to derive a structure-aware scoring matrix for sparse top-$P$ edge recovery. This integration offers three advantages: (1) Robustness to accidental deletion, as important edges can be recovered by SVD-guided scoring; (2) Enrichment with missing links, creating more informative contrastive views by introducing semantically meaningful edges; and (3) Controllable structural discrepancy, ensuring contrastive signals stem from semantic differences rather than edge-number gaps.Furthermore, we incorporate a contrastive fusion module with a global similarity constraint to align embeddings. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPGCL consistently improves the robustness and accuracy of GNNs, outperforming state-of-the-art GCL and structure learning methods, validating its effectiveness in integrating previously disparate paradigms.</p></details> |  |

The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-026-51718-4}</p></details> |
| **[GraphAllocBench: A Flexible Benchmark for Preference-Conditioned Multi-Objective Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20753v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-Conditioned Policy Learning (PCPL) in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) aims to approximate diverse Pareto-optimal solutions by conditioning policies on user-specified preferences over objectives. This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</p></details> |  |

Previous graph neural network (GNN) models leverage molecular structures and interaction networks but mostly rely on linear aggregation and symmetric assumptions, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear and heterogeneous patterns. We propose MGKAN, a Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network that introduces learnable basis functions into asymmetric DDI prediction. MGKAN replaces conventional MLP transformations with KAN-driven basis functions, enabling more expressive and nonlinear modeling of drug relationships. To capture pharmacological dependencies, MGKAN integrates three network views-an asymmetric DDI network, a co-interaction network, and a biochemical similarity network-with role-specific embeddings to preserve directional semantics. A fusion module combines linear attention and nonlinear transformation to enhance representational capacity. On two benchmark datasets, MGKAN outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies and case studies confirm its predictive accuracy and effectiveness in modeling directional drug effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

To prune the search space, recent methods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few ``important" objects predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical objects and wasting resources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning, we introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance prediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural network to predict object importance to create a simplified task and solve it with a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick rough plan, and reintegrate all referenced objects into the simplified task to recover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary rules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze navigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact with movable obstacles. The results show that Flax boosts the average success rate by 20.82\% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65\% compared with the state-of-the-art NeSy baseline. We expect that Flax offers a practical path toward fast, scalable, long-horizon task planning in complex environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

Our construction generalizes the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson zero-knowledge protocol to arbitrary k >= 3, applies the Fiat-Shamir transform, and uses Merkle-tree commitments to compress signatures from O(tn) to O(t log n). Crucially, we generate hard instances via planted "quiet" colorings that preserve the statistical profile of random graphs. We present the first empirical security analysis of such a scheme against both classical solvers (ILP, DSatur) and a custom graph neural network (GNN) attacker. Experiments show that for n >= 60, neither approach recovers the secret coloring, demonstrating that well-engineered k-coloring instances can resist modern cryptanalysis, including machine learning. This revives combinatorial hardness as a credible foundation for post-quantum signatures.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

Building on GraphRAG, we construct a domain-specific knowledge graph and retrieve query-relevant subgraphs to provide relational evidence during answer generation. The framework adopts ChatGLM as the Transformer backbone with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and employs a graph neural network to learn node representations that capture symptom-disease-treatment dependencies. By explicitly modeling diseases, symptoms, pesticides, and control measures as linked entities, the system supports evidence-aware retrieval beyond surface-level text similarity. Retrieved graph evidence is incorporated into the LLM input to guide generation toward domain-consistent recommendations and to mitigate hallucinated or inappropriate treatments. Experimental results show consistent improvements over text-only baselines, with the largest gains observed on multi-hop and comparative reasoning questions that require chaining multiple relations.</p></details> |  |

We propose a robust SASV framework in which a spoofing detector and a speaker verification (SV) network operate in tandem. The spoofing detector employs a self-supervised speech embedding extractor as the frontend, combined with a state-of-the-art graph neural network backend. In addition, a top-3 layer based mixture-of-experts (MoE) is used to fuse high-level and low-level features for effective spoofed utterance detection. For speaker verification, we adapt a low-complexity convolutional neural network that fuses 2D and 1D features at multiple scales, trained with the SphereFace loss. Additionally, contrastive circle loss is applied to adaptively weight positive and negative pairs within each training batch, enabling the network to better distinguish between hard and easy sample pairs. Finally, fixed imposter cohort based AS Norm score normalization and model ensembling are used to further enhance the discriminative capability of the speaker verification system.</p></details> |  |

| **[Graph Homomorphism Distortion: A Metric to Distinguish Them All and in the Latent Space Bind Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03068v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large driver of the complexity of graph learning is the interplay between structure and features.When analyzing the expressivity of graph neural networks, however, existing approaches ignore features in favor of structure, making it nigh-impossible to assess to what extent two graphs with close features should be considered similar.We address this by developing a new (pseudo-)metric based on graph homomorphisms.Inspired by concepts from metric geometry, our graph homomorphism distortion measures the minimal worst-case distortion that node features of one graph are subjected to when mapping one graph to another.We demonstrate the utility of our novel measure by showing that (i.) it can be efficiently calculated under some additional assumptions, (ii.) it complements existing expressivity measures like $1$-WL, and (iii.)it permits defining structural encodings, which improve the predictive capabilities of graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |

We propose \textbf{PIMPC-GNN}, a physics-informed multi-phase consensus framework for imbalanced node classification. Our method integrates three complementary dynamics: (i) thermodynamic diffusion, which spreads minority labels to capture long-range dependencies, (ii) Kuramoto synchronisation, which aligns minority nodes through oscillatory consensus, and (iii) spectral embedding, which separates classes via structural regularisation. These perspectives are combined through class-adaptive ensemble weighting and trained with an imbalance-aware loss that couples balanced cross-entropy with physics-based constraints. Across five benchmark datasets and imbalance ratios from 5-100, PIMPC-GNN outperforms 16 state-of-the-art baselines, achieving notable gains in minority-class recall (up to +12.7\%) and balanced accuracy (up to +8.3\%). Beyond empirical improvements, the framework also provides interpretable insights into consensus dynamics in graph learning. The code is available at \texttt{https://github.com/afofanah/PIMPC-GNN}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01872v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preservation Theorems for Unravelling-Invariant Classes: A Uniform Approach for Modal Logics and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01856v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study preservation theorems for modal logics over finite structures with respect to three fundamental semantic relations: embeddings, injective homomorphisms, and homomorphisms. We focus on classes of pointed Kripke models that are invariant under bounded unravellings, a natural locality condition satisfied by modal logics and by graph neural networks (GNNs). We show that preservation under embeddings coincides with definability in existential graded modal logic; preservation under injective homomorphisms with definability in existential positive graded modal logic; and preservation under homomorphisms with definability in existential positive modal logic. A key technical contribution is a structural well-quasi-ordering result. We prove that the embedding relation on classes of tree-shaped models of uniformly bounded height forms a well-quasi-order, and that the bounded-height assumption is essential. This well-quasi-ordering yields a finite minimal-tree argument leading to explicit syntactic characterisations via finite disjunctions of (graded) modal formulae. As an application, we derive consequences for the expressive power of GNNs. Using our preservation theorem for injective homomorphisms, we obtain a new logical characterisation of monotonic GNNs, showing that they capture exactly existential-positive graded modal logic, while monotonic GNNs with MAX aggregation correspond precisely to existential-positive modal logic.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks Under the Microscope: The Role of Geometry-Task Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01828v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex networks exhibit hyperbolic structural properties, making hyperbolic space a natural candidate for representing hierarchical and tree-like graphs with low distortion. Based on this observation, Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted as a principled choice for representation learning on tree-like graphs. In this work, we question this paradigm by proposing an additional condition of geometry-task alignment, i.e., whether the metric structure of the target follows that of the input graph. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the capability of HGNNs to recover low-distortion representations on two synthetic regression problems, and show that their geometric inductive bias becomes helpful when the problem requires preserving metric structure. Additionally, we evaluate HGNNs on the tasks of link prediction and node classification by jointly analyzing predictive performance and embedding distortion, revealing that only link prediction is geometry-aligned. Overall, our findings shift the focus from only asking "Is the graph hyperbolic?" to also questioning "Is the task aligned with hyperbolic geometry?", showing that HGNNs consistently outperform Euclidean models under such alignment, while their advantage vanishes otherwise.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

We present a systematic approach for constructing continuous rotationally invariant and equivariant functions using symmetric tensor networks. The proposed framework supports inputs and outputs given as a tuple of Cartesian tensors of different rank as well as spherical tensors of different type. We introduce tensor network generators for invariant maps and obtain equivariant maps via differentiation. Specifically, we derive general continuous equivariant maps from vector inputs to Cartesian or spherical tensor output. Finally, we clarify how common equivariant primitives in geometric graph neural networks arise within our construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plain Transformers are Surprisingly Powerful Link Predictors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01553v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a core challenge in graph machine learning, demanding models that capture rich and complex topological dependencies. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features. Our results challenge the prevailing reliance on complex engineering techniques, demonstrating that simple design choices are potentially sufficient to achieve the same capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Qrita: High-performance Top-k and Top-p Algorithm for GPUs using Pivot-based Truncation and Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01518v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Top-k and Top-p are the dominant truncation operators in the sampling of large language models. Despite their widespread use, implementing them efficiently over large vocabularies remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on sorting, which incur significant computation and memory overhead on GPUs, or stochastic approaches, which alter the algorithm output. In this work, we propose Qrita, an efficient Top-k and Top-p algorithm based on a pivot-based selection strategy. Based on RTop-k, which uses a pivot-based search for node selection in graph neural networks, Qrita extends the concept of pivot-based search to both Top-k and Top-p with two key techniques: 1. Gaussian-based sigma-truncation, which greatly reduces the search space of the target elements, and 2. Quaternary pivot search with duplication handling, which halves the pivot search iteration and guarantees deterministic output. We provide the full implementation of Qrita using Triton, a popular GPU programming language. Our evaluation of Qrita against the Top-k and Top-p kernels of high performance LLM execution engines such as vLLM, SGLang, and Flashinfer show that Qrita achieves up to 2 times throughput and half memory use while providing the same output to the the sorting-based algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost. These findings highlight the crucial role of structural context in detecting online incivility and address the limitations of text-only LLM paradigms in behavioral prediction. All datasets and comparative outputs will be publicly available in our repository to support further research and reproducibility.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Despite their growing popularity and success across various applications, GNNs encounter several challenges that limit their performance. in their generalization, robustness to adversarial perturbations, and the effectiveness of their representation learning capabilities. In this dissertation, I investigate these core aspects through three main contributions: (1) developing new representation learning techniques based on Graph Shift Operators (GSOs, aiming for enhanced performance across various contexts and applications, (2) introducing generalization-enhancing methods through graph data augmentation, and (3) developing more robust GNNs by leveraging orthonormalization techniques and noise-based defenses against adversarial attacks. By addressing these challenges, my work provides a more principled understanding of the limitations and potential of GNNs.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

Spiking neural networks offer event-driven efficiency but remain limited by sequential propagation, binary information loss, and local aggregation that misses global context. We propose ChronoSpike, an adaptive spiking graph neural network that integrates learnable LIF neurons with per-channel membrane dynamics, multi-head attentive spatial aggregation on continuous features, and a lightweight Transformer temporal encoder, enabling both fine-grained local modeling and long-range dependency capture with linear memory complexity $O(T \cdot d)$. On three large-scale benchmarks, ChronoSpike outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baselines by $2.0\%$ Macro-F1 and $2.4\%$ Micro-F1 while achieving $3-10\times$ faster training than recurrent methods with a constant 105K-parameter budget independent of graph size. We provide theoretical guarantees for membrane potential boundedness, gradient flow stability under contraction factor $ρ< 1$, and BIBO stability; interpretability analyses reveal heterogeneous temporal receptive fields and a learned primacy effect with $83-88\%$ sparsity.</p></details> |  |

In such settings, an adversary that compromises a small number of edge devices may inject counterfeit nodes (e.g., rogue sensors, virtualized endpoints, or spoofed substations) to bias downstream decisions while evading topology- and homophily-based sanitization. This paper formulates deployment-oriented node-injection attacks under constrained resources and proposes the \emph{Single-Edge Graph Injection Attack} (SEGIA), in which each injected node attaches to the operational graph through a single edge. SEGIA integrates a pruned SGC surrogate, multi-hop neighborhood sampling, and reverse graph convolution-based feature synthesis with a similarity-regularized objective to preserve local homophily and survive edge pruning. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations across datasets and defenses show at least $25\%$ higher attack success than representative baselines under substantially smaller edge budgets. These results indicate a system-level risk in industrial GNN deployments and motivate lightweight admission validation and neighborhood-consistency monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Yet discovering GPCR modulators remains challenging because receptor activation often arises from complex allosteric effects rather than direct binding affinity, and conventional assays are slow, costly, and not optimized for capturing these dynamics. Here we present GPCR-Filter, a deep learning framework specifically developed for GPCR modulator discovery. We assembled a high-quality dataset of over 90,000 experimentally validated GPCR-ligand pairs, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluation. GPCR-Filter integrates the ESM-3 protein language model for high-fidelity GPCR sequence representations with graph neural networks that encode ligand structures, coupled through an attention-based fusion mechanism that learns receptor-ligand functional relationships. Across multiple evaluation settings, GPCR-Filter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compound-protein interaction models and exhibits strong generalization to unseen receptors and ligands. Notably, the model successfully identified micromolar-level agonists of the 5-HT\textsubscript{1A} receptor with distinct chemical frameworks. These results establish GPCR-Filter as a scalable and effective computational approach for GPCR modulator discovery, advancing AI-assisted drug development for complex signaling systems.</p></details> |  |

In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional spatial partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that DistMLIP can simulate atomic systems 3.4x larger and up to 8x faster compared to previous multi-GPU methods. We show that existing foundation potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 tables with 2 figures, code repo included in the manuscript</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multiscale Graph-based Protein Learning with Geometric Secondary Structural Motifs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00862v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning protein structures by capturing spatial relationships at the residue level. However, existing GNN-based methods often face challenges in learning multiscale representations and modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. In this work, we propose an efficient multiscale graph-based learning framework tailored to proteins. Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $α$-helices, $β$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchical framework preserves the desired maximal expressiveness, ensuring no loss of critical structural information. Empirically, we demonstrate that integrating baseline GNNs into our multiscale framework remarkably improves prediction accuracy and reduces computational cost across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce AutoGNN, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to address these challenges by leveraging FPGA's reconfigurability and specialized components. AutoGNN adapts to diverse graph inputs, efficiently performing computationally intensive tasks such as graph conversion and sampling. By utilizing components like adder trees, AutoGNN executes reduction operations in constant time, overcoming the limitations of serialization and synchronization on GPUs. AutoGNN integrates unified processing elements (UPEs) and single-cycle reducers (SCRs) to streamline GNN preprocessing. UPEs enable scalable parallel processing for edge sorting and unique vertex selection, while SCRs efficiently handle sequential tasks such as pointer array construction and subgraph reindexing. A user-level software framework dynamically profiles graph inputs, determines optimal configurations, and reprograms AutoGNN to handle varying workloads. Implemented on a 7$n$m enterprise FPGA, AutoGNN achieves up to 9.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$ speedup compared to conventional and GPU-accelerated preprocessing systems, respectively, enabling high-performance GNN preprocessing across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10figures |

A key challenge is the severe lack of training data, as many properties are too complicated to calculate with high-throughput first principles techniques. To address this, recent research has created experimental databases from information extracted from scientific literature. However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally. We demonstrate significant improvements in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correct Classification Rate (CCR) in predicting the ordering temperatures and magnetic ground states of magnetic materials, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, submitted to Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials</p></details> |

| **[Kernelized Edge Attention: Addressing Semantic Attention Blurring in Temporal Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00596v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) aim to capture the evolving structure and timing of interactions in dynamic graphs. Although many models incorporate time through encodings or architectural design, they often compute attention over entangled node and edge representations, failing to reflect their distinct temporal behaviors. Node embeddings evolve slowly as they aggregate long-term structural context, while edge features reflect transient, timestamped interactions (e.g. messages, trades, or transactions). This mismatch results in semantic attention blurring, where attention weights cannot distinguish between slowly drifting node states and rapidly changing, information-rich edge interactions. As a result, models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and provide limited transparency into how temporal relevance is computed. This paper introduces KEAT (Kernelized Edge Attention for Temporal Graphs), a novel attention formulation that modulates edge features using a family of continuous-time kernels, including Laplacian, RBF, and learnable MLP variant. KEAT preserves the distinct roles of nodes and edges, and integrates seamlessly with both Transformer-style (e.g., DyGFormer) and message-passing (e.g., TGN) architectures. It achieves up to 18% MRR improvement over the recent DyGFormer and 7% over TGN on link prediction tasks, enabling more accurate, interpretable and temporally aware message passing in TGNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) embedding framework that integrates graph neural network representations with dynamically retrieved literature-derived knowledge through contrastive learning. Benchmarking against ten embedding methods reveals task-specific complementarity: topology-focused methods achieve near-perfect link prediction (GCN: 0.983 AUROC), while RAG-GNN is the only method achieving positive silhouette scores for functional clustering (0.001 vs. negative scores for all baselines). Information-theoretic decomposition shows network topology contributes 77.3% of predictive information, while retrieved documents provide 8.6% unique information. Applied to cancer signaling networks (379 proteins, 3,498 interactions), the framework identifies DDR1 as a therapeutic target based on retrieved evidence of synthetic lethality with KRAS mutations. These results establish that topology-only and retrieval-augmented approaches serve complementary purposes: structural prediction tasks are solved by network topology alone, while functional interpretation uniquely benefits from retrieved knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[FloydNet: A Learning Paradigm for Global Relational Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19094v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

Although post-training model editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE (HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i) Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincaré embeddings to represent knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) Möbius-Transformed Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact, CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fed-Listing: Federated Label Distribution Inference in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00407v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been intensively studied for their expressive representation and learning performance on graph-structured data, enabling effective modeling of complex relational dependencies among nodes and edges in various domains. However, the standalone GNNs can unleash threat surfaces and privacy implications, as some sensitive graph-structured data is collected and processed in a centralized setting. To solve this issue, Federated Graph Neural Networks (FedGNNs) are proposed to facilitate collaborative learning over decentralized local graph data, aiming to preserve user privacy. Yet, emerging research indicates that even in these settings, shared model updates, particularly gradients, can unintentionally leak sensitive information of local users. Numerous privacy inference attacks have been explored in traditional federated learning and extended to graph settings, but the problem of label distribution inference in FedGNNs remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fed-Listing (Federated Label Distribution Inference in GNNs), a novel gradient-based attack designed to infer the private label statistics of target clients in FedGNNs without access to raw data or node features. Fed-Listing only leverages the final-layer gradients exchanged during training to uncover statistical patterns that reveal class proportions in a stealthy manner. An auxiliary shadow dataset is used to generate diverse label partitioning strategies, simulating various client distributions, on which the attack model is obtained. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three GNN architectures show that Fed-Listing significantly outperforms existing baselines, including random guessing and Decaf, even under challenging non-i.i.d. scenarios. Moreover, applying defense mechanisms can barely reduce our attack performance, unless the model's utility is severely degraded.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, and 5 tables</p></details> |

The two networks interact with each other at the layer level to find a saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal GNN finds a stationary point for a given dual multiplier, while the dual network iteratively refines its estimates to reach an optimal solution. We force the primal and dual networks to mirror the dynamics of the DA algorithm by imposing descent and ascent constraints. We propose a joint training scheme that alternates between updating the primal and dual networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach yields near-optimal near-feasible solutions and generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Transport-Guided Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Network-Based Bot Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00318v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of bot accounts on social media poses significant risks to public discourse. To address this threat, modern bot detectors increasingly rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the effectiveness of these GNN-based detectors in real-world settings remains poorly understood. In practice, attackers continuously adapt their strategies as well as must operate under domain-specific and temporal constraints, which can fundamentally limit the applicability of existing attack methods. As a result, there is a critical need for robust GNN-based bot detection methods under realistic, constraint-aware attack scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce BOCLOAK to systematically evaluate the robustness of GNN-based social bot detection via both edge editing and node injection adversarial attacks under realistic constraints. BOCLOAK constructs a probability measure over spatio-temporal neighbor features and learns an optimal transport geometry that separates human and bot behaviors. It then decodes transport plans into sparse, plausible edge edits that evade detection while obeying real-world constraints. We evaluate BOCLOAK across three social bot datasets, five state-of-the-art bot detectors, three adversarial defenses, and compare it against four leading graph adversarial attack baselines. BOCLOAK achieves up to 80.13% higher attack success rates while using 99.80% less GPU memory under realistic real-world constraints. Most importantly, BOCLOAK shows that optimal transport provides a lightweight, principled framework for bridging the gap between adversarial attacks and real-world bot detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00647v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs). Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we shift our attention to GNNs that perform message passing on edges and introduce EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding architecture, EB-GNN. Our EB-GNN architecture is inspired by the classic triangle-counting algorithm of Chiba and Nishizeki and passes messages along edges and triangles. Our contributions are as follows: (1) Theoretically, we show that EB-1WL is significantly more expressive than 1WL. We provide a complete logical characterization of EB-1WL in first-order logic, along with distinguishability results via homomorphism counting. To the best of our knowledge, EB-GNN has the strongest theoretical expressivity guarantees among edge-based message-passing GNNs in the literature. (2) Unlike many GNN architectures that are more expressive than 1WL, we prove that EB-1WL and EB-GNN admit near-linear time and memory usage on practical graph learning workloads. (3) We show in experiments that EB-GNN is a highly efficient general-purpose architecture: it substantially outperforms simple MPNNs and remains competitive with task-specialized state-of-the-art GNNs at substantially lower computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Attention Network for Node Regression on Random Geometric Graphs with Erdős--Rényi contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23239v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph attention networks (GATs) are widely used and often appear robust to noise in node covariates and edges, yet rigorous statistical guarantees demonstrating a provable advantage of GATs over non-attention graph neural networks~(GNNs) are scarce. We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent covariates are observed; and the sample graph is a random geometric graph created from the node covariates but contaminated by independent Erdős--Rényi edges. We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions. Our analysis leverages high-dimensional geometric tail bounds and concentration for neighbourhood counts and sample covariances. We verify our theoretical findings through experiments on synthetically generated data. We also perform experiments on real-world graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in several node regression tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sequence Diffusion Model for Temporal Link Prediction in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23233v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a fundamental problem in many real-world systems. Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling multispecific antibody function with graph neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23212v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multispecific antibodies offer transformative therapeutic potential by engaging multiple epitopes simultaneously, yet their efficacy is an emergent property governed by complex molecular architectures. Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains. This work provides a robust benchmarking environment for disentangling the combinatorial complexity of multispecifics, accelerating the design of next-generation therapeutics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, code available at https://github.com/prescient-design/synapse</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Execute Graph Algorithms Exactly with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23207v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding what graph neural networks can learn, especially their ability to learn to execute algorithms, remains a central theoretical challenge. In this work, we prove exact learnability results for graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision constraints. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation. We further demonstrate positive learnability results for widely studied algorithms such as message flooding, breadth-first and depth-first search, and Bellman-Ford.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning and extrapolating scale-invariant processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14810v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</p></details> | 29p, 22 figures |
| **[Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening with Graph Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22943v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph coarsening reduces the size of a graph while preserving certain properties. Most existing methods preserve either spectral or spatial characteristics. Recent research has shown that preserving topological features helps maintain the predictive performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on the coarsened graph but suffers from exponential time complexity. To address these problems, we propose Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening (STPGC) by introducing the concepts of graph strong collapse and graph edge collapse extended from algebraic topology. STPGC comprises three new algorithms, GStrongCollapse, GEdgeCollapse, and NeighborhoodConing based on these two concepts, which eliminate dominated nodes and edges while rigorously preserving topological features. We further prove that STPGC preserves the GNN receptive field and develop approximate algorithms to accelerate GNN training. Experiments on node classification with GNNs demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of STPGC.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNN Explanations that do not Explain and How to find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20815v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explanations provided by Self-explainable Graph Neural Networks (SE-GNNs) are fundamental for understanding the model's inner workings and for identifying potential misuse of sensitive attributes. Although recent works have highlighted that these explanations can be suboptimal and potentially misleading, a characterization of their failure cases is unavailable. In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings. Our code is available in the supplemental.</p></details> | Accepted at ICLR26 |

However, due to differences in training protocols, forecast horizons, and data choices, it remains unclear which (if any) of these methods and architectures are most suitable for weather forecasting and for future model development. Here, we step back and provide a detailed empirical analysis, under controlled conditions, comparing and contrasting the most prominent DLWP models, along with their backbones. We accomplish this by predicting synthetic two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes and real-world global weather dynamics. On synthetic data, we observe favorable performance of FNO, while on the real-world WeatherBench dataset, our results demonstrate the suitability of ConvLSTM and SwinTransformer for short-to-mid-ranged forecasts. For long-ranged weather rollouts of up to 50 years, we observe superior stability and physical soundness in architectures that formulate a spherical data representation, i.e., GraphCast and Spherical FNO.

While CP algorithms have evolved beyond traditional classifiers and regressors to sophisticated deep learning models like deep neural networks (DNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs), existing CP libraries often lack the model support and scalability for large-scale deep learning (DL) scenarios. This paper introduces TorchCP, a PyTorch-native library designed to integrate state-of-the-art CP algorithms into DL techniques, including DNN-based classifiers/regressors, GNNs, and LLMs. Released under the LGPL-3.0 license, TorchCP comprises about 16k lines of code, validated with 100\% unit test coverage and detailed documentation. Notably, TorchCP enables CP-specific training algorithms, online prediction, and GPU-accelerated batch processing, achieving up to 90\% reduction in inference time on large datasets. With its low-coupling design, comprehensive suite of advanced methods, and full GPU scalability, TorchCP empowers researchers and practitioners to enhance uncertainty quantification across cutting-edge applications.</p></details> |  |

A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings. The implementation can be found in the github link: https://github.com/LIUMENGFAN-gif/GNN_fullgraph_minibatch_training.</p></details> |  |
| **[NAG: A Unified Native Architecture for Encoder-free Text-Graph Modeling in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22657v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing methods for integrating graphs into Language Models (LMs) typically rely on a segregated architecture: external Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encode structural topology, while LMs process textual semantics. We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However, existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions, exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures. Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data. Importantly, AFG can be used to extract granular explanations needed to increase transparency for malware detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed AFG and Meta-Coarsening approach can provide both increased explainability and inference performance at certain coarsening levels. However, most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider granular explainability in malware detection using GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Explainability techniques (XAI) have made remarkable progress in the interpretability of ML models. However, the non-euclidean nature of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) makes it difficult to reuse already existing XAI methods. While other works have focused on instance-based explanation methods for GNNs, very few have investigated model-based methods and, to our knowledge, none have tried to probe the embedding of the GNNs for structural graph properties. In this paper we present a model agnostic explainability pipeline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) employing diagnostic classifiers. We propose to consider graph-theoretic properties as the features of choice for studying the emergence of representations in GNNs. This pipeline aims to probe and interpret the learned representations in GNNs across various architectures and datasets, refining our understanding and trust in these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 22 figures, conference</p></details> |

By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Fourth Learning on Graphs Conference (LoG 2025)</p></details> |
| **[How Expressive Are Graph Neural Networks in the Presence of Node Identifiers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21882v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a widely used class of machine learning models for graph-structured data, based on local aggregation over neighbors. GNNs have close connections to logic. In particular, their expressive power is linked to that of modal logics and bounded-variable logics with counting. In many practical scenarios, graphs processed by GNNs have node features that act as unique identifiers. In this work, we study how such identifiers affect the expressive power of GNNs. We initiate a study of the key-invariant expressive power of GNNs, inspired by the notion of order-invariant definability in finite model theory: which node queries that depend only on the underlying graph structure can GNNs express on graphs with unique node identifiers? We provide answers for various classes of GNNs with local max- or sum-aggregation.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost.</p></details> |  |

Despite its influence, this perspective leaves two gaps: (i) it is unclear whether WL tests are sufficiently primitive for understanding GNN expressivity, and (ii) WL-induced equivalence does not align well with characterizing the function classes that GNNs can approximate or compute. We attempt to address both gaps. First, we strengthen hardness results for the vanilla WL test, showing that in many settings it is not primitive enough to be implemented by constant-depth GNNs. Second, we propose an alternative framework for studying GNN expressivity based on an extended CONGEST model with an explicit preprocessing phase. Within this framework, we identify implicit shortcuts introduced in prior analyses and establish further results for WL tests in settings where graphs are augmented with virtual nodes and virtual edges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Parameter Finetuning: Test-Time Representation Refinement for Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21615v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks frequently exhibit significant performance degradation in the out-of-distribution test scenario. While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings. Empirically, extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTReFT achieves consistent and superior performance. Our work establishes representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph TTT, offering both theoretical grounding and immediate practical utility for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneity-Aware Knowledge Sharing for Graph Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21589v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Federated Learning (GFL) enables distributed graph representation learning while protecting the privacy of graph data. However, GFL suffers from heterogeneity arising from diverse node features and structural topologies across multiple clients. To address both types of heterogeneity, we propose a novel graph Federated learning method via Semantic and Structural Alignment (FedSSA), which shares the knowledge of both node features and structural topologies. For node feature heterogeneity, we propose a novel variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, so that we can cluster clients based on inferred distributions and construct cluster-level representative distributions. We then minimize the divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing. For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing. Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning settings demonstrate that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[Mean-Field Control on Sparse Graphs: From Local Limits to GNNs via Neighborhood Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21477v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mean-field control (MFC) offers a scalable solution to the curse of dimensionality in multi-agent systems but traditionally hinges on the restrictive assumption of exchangeability via dense, all-to-all interactions. In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world network structures by proposing a rigorous framework for MFC on large sparse graphs. We redefine the system state as a probability measure over decorated rooted neighborhoods, effectively capturing local heterogeneity. Our central contribution is a theoretical foundation for scalable reinforcement learning in this setting. We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood. This result renders the infinite-dimensional control problem tractable and underpins a novel Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) on the lifted space of neighborhood distributions. Furthermore, we formally and experimentally justify the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for actor-critic algorithms in this context. Our framework naturally recovers classical MFC as a degenerate case while enabling efficient, theoretically grounded control on complex sparse topologies.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Rethinking Federated Graph Foundation Models: A Graph-Language Alignment-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21369v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments. To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review.

While graph neural networks (GNNs) capture structured graph information and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in semantic comprehension, current approaches lack integration at the reasoning level. We propose HetGCoT, a framework enabling LLMs to effectively leverage and learn information from graphs to reason interpretable academic QA results. Our framework introduces three technical contributions: (1) a framework that transforms heterogeneous graph structural information into LLM-processable reasoning chains, (2) an adaptive metapath selection mechanism identifying relevant subgraphs for specific queries, and (3) a multi-step reasoning strategy systematically incorporating graph contexts into the reasoning process. Experiments on OpenAlex and DBLP datasets show our approach outperforms all sota baselines. The framework demonstrates adaptability across different LLM architectures and applicability to various scholarly question answering tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Trained with reinforcement learning (RL), the state-of-the-art graph attention model (GAM) achieves near-optimal solutions without requiring expert knowledge or labeled data. In this work, we generalize the existing graph attention mechanism and propose the extended graph attention model (EGAM). Our model utilizes multi-head dot-product attention to update both node and edge embeddings, addressing the limitations of the conventional GAM, which considers only node features. We employ an autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture and train it with policy gradient algorithms that incorporate a specially designed baseline. Experiments show that EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance on highly constrained problems, highlighting its efficiency in handling complex graph structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fair Graph Machine Learning under Adversarial Missingness Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01591v5)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many relevant tasks where decisions might disproportionately impact specific communities. However, existing work on fair GNNs often assumes that either sensitive attributes are fully observed or they are missing completely at random. We show that an adversarial missingness process can inadvertently disguise a fair model through the imputation, leading the model to overestimate the fairness of its predictions. We address this challenge by proposing Better Fair than Sorry (BFtS), a fair missing data imputation model for sensitive attributes. The key principle behind BFtS is that imputations should approximate the worst-case scenario for fairness -- i.e. when optimizing fairness is the hardest. We implement this idea using a 3-player adversarial scheme where two adversaries collaborate against a GNN classifier, and the classifier minimizes the maximum bias. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets show that BFtS often achieves a better fairness x accuracy trade-off than existing alternatives under an adversarial missingness process.</p></details> |  |

Such techniques usually involve solving large, sparse linear systems, where preconditioning methods are critical. In recent years, neural methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated their potential through accelerated convergence. Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.</p></details> |  |

We build paired citation graphs, ground truth and GPT-4o-generated (from parametric knowledge), for 10,000 focal papers ($\approx$ 275k references) from SciSciNet, and added a field-matched random baseline that preserves out-degree and field distributions while breaking latent structure. We compare (i) structure-only node features (degree/closeness/eigenvector centrality, clustering, edge count) with (ii) 3072-D title/abstract embeddings, using an RF on graph-level aggregates and Graph Neural Networks with node features. Structure alone barely separates GPT from ground truth (RF accuracy $\approx$ 0.60) despite cleanly rejecting the random baseline ($\approx$ 0.89--0.92). By contrast, embeddings sharply increase separability: RF on aggregated embeddings reaches $\approx$ 0.83, and GNNs with embedding node features achieve 93\% test accuracy on GPT vs.\ ground truth. We show the robustness of our findings by replicating the pipeline with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and with multiple embedding models (OpenAI and SPECTER), with RF separability for ground truth vs.\ Claude $\approx 0.77$ and clean rejection of the random baseline. Thus, LLM bibliographies, generated purely from parametric knowledge, closely mimic human citation topology, but leave detectable semantic fingerprints; detection and debiasing should target content signals rather than global graph structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 20 figures.

However, large-scale networks present unique challenges: they contain hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges with heterogeneous and overlapping community structures that evolve over time. Existing approaches face notable limitations: traditional graph neural networks struggle to capture global structural dependencies, while recent graph transformers achieve strong performance but incur quadratic complexity and lack interpretable latent structure. We propose \textbf{TGSBM} (Transformer-Guided Stochastic Block Model), a framework that integrates the principled generative structure of Overlapping Stochastic Block Models with the representational power of sparse Graph Transformers. TGSBM comprises three main components: (i) \emph{expander-augmented sparse attention} that enables near-linear complexity and efficient global mixing, (ii) a \emph{neural variational encoder} that infers structured posteriors over community memberships and strengths, and (iii) a \emph{neural edge decoder} that reconstructs links via OSBM's generative process, preserving interpretability. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance (mean rank 1.6 under HeaRT protocol), superior scalability (up to $6\times$ faster training), and interpretable community structures. These results position TGSBM as a practical approach that strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and transparency for large-scale link prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Taxonomy of reduction matrices for Graph Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11743v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix, which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCMamba: Selective State-Space Models for Higher-Order Graph Learning on Combinatorial Complexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20518v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological deep learning has emerged for modeling higher-order relational structures beyond pairwise interactions that standard graph neural networks fail to capture. Although combinatorial complexes offer a unified topological framework, most existing topological deep learning methods rely on local message passing via attention mechanisms, which incur quadratic complexity and remain low-dimensional, limiting scalability and rank-aware information aggregation in higher-order complexes.We propose Combinatorial Complex Mamba (CCMamba), the first unified mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes. CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Experiments on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks demonstrate that CCMamba consistently outperforms existing methods while exhibiting improved scalability and robustness to depth.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCL-OT: Graph Contrastive Learning with Optimal Transport for Heterophilic Text-Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16778v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, structure-text contrastive learning has shown promising performance on text-attributed graphs by leveraging the complementary strengths of graph neural networks and language models. However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages.

| **[Proactive SFC Provisioning with Forecast-Driven DRL in Data Centers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20229v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service Function Chaining (SFC) requires efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to satisfy diverse service requirements while maintaining high resource utilization in Data Centers (DCs). Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively. This strategy ensures more balanced resource allocation, and reduces contention.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2026</p></details> |
| **[The Effect of Architecture During Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19766v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting. To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.</p></details> |  |

Labelling remote sensing imagery is time and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work, we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be formed within the encoding space. Our pipeline achieves high contextual consistency, with similarity scores of SSIM = 0.96 and SAM = 0.21 under context-aware evaluation, demonstrating robust organisation of the feature space for interactive labelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Taylor and Francis, Annals of GIS * Video supplement demonstrating feature-space exploration and interactive labelling is available at: https://youtu.be/GZl1ebZJgEA and is archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16676591</p></details> |
| **[Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02528v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of deep-learning-based, graph-neural-network-based forecasting methods for modern intelligent transportation systems. However, most existing work focuses exclusively on capturing spatio-temporal dependencies from historical traffic data, while overlooking the fact that suddenly occurring transportation incidents, such as traffic accidents and adverse weather, serve as external disturbances that can substantially alter temporal patterns. We argue that this issue has become a major obstacle to modeling the dynamics of traffic systems and improving prediction accuracy, but the unpredictability of incidents makes it difficult to observe patterns from historical sequences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework named the Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN). IGSTGNN explicitly models the incident's impact through two core components: an Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture the initial heterogeneous spatial influence, and a Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model the subsequent dynamic dissipation. To facilitate research on the spatio-temporal impact of incidents on traffic flow, a large-scale dataset is constructed and released, featuring incident records that are time-aligned with traffic time series. On this new benchmark, the proposed IGSTGNN framework is demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the generalizability of the ICSF and TIID modules is validated by integrating them into various existing models.</p></details> |  |

There is a growing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling the increasing variability, constraints, and uncertainties in modern power networks while providing accurate and fast solutions. To address this, machine learning techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising approaches. This letter introduces PowerGraph-LLM, the first framework explicitly designed for solving OPF problems using Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed approach combines graph and tabular representations of power grids to effectively query LLMs, capturing the complex relationships and constraints in power systems. A new implementation of in-context learning and fine-tuning protocols for LLMs is introduced, tailored specifically for the OPF problem. PowerGraph-LLM demonstrates reliable performances using off-the-shelf LLM.

| **[Fixed Aggregation Features Can Rival GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19449v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely believed to excel at node representation learning through trainable neighborhood aggregations. We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.</p></details> |  |

These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.</p></details> |  |

We introduced KOCOBrain: KuramotO COupled Brain Graph Network; a unified graph neural network framework that integrates structural and functional connectomes via Kuramoto-based phase dynamics and cognition-aware attention. The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario. Applied to the ABCD cohort, KOCOBrain improved prenatal drug exposure prediction over relevant baselines and revealed interpretable structure-function patterns that reflect disrupted brain network coordination associated with early exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version of the paper accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2026).

| **[Traffic Engineering in Large-scale Networks with Generalizable Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24203v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Engineering (TE) in large-scale networks like cloud Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations is a critical challenge. Although learning-based approaches have been proposed to address the scalability of traditional TE algorithms, their practical application is often hindered by a lack of generalization, high training overhead, and a failure to respect link capacities. This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale network scenarios, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact underlying network topology or traffic patterns, and is able to very efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands. We train and evaluate TELGEN with random and real-world topologies, with networks of up to 5000 nodes and 3.6x10^6 links in testing. TELGEN shows less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all testing scenarios, even when the test network has 2-20x more nodes than the largest training network. It also saves up to 84% TE solving time than traditional interior-point method, and reduces up to 79.6% training time per epoch than the state-of-the-art learning-based algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE Transactions on Networking</p></details> |
| **[XIMP: Cross Graph Inter-Message Passing for Molecular Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19037v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate molecular property prediction is central to drug discovery, yet graph neural networks often underperform in data-scarce regimes and fail to surpass traditional fingerprints. We introduce cross-graph inter-message passing (XIMP), which performs message passing both within and across multiple related graph representations. For small molecules, we combine the molecular graph with scaffold-aware junction trees and pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs, integrating complementary abstractions. While prior work is either limited to a single abstraction or non-iterative communication across graphs, XIMP supports an arbitrary number of abstractions and both direct and indirect communication between them in each layer. Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, leveraging interpretable abstractions as an inductive bias that guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization in low-data settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v4)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |
