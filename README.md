| **[A Critical Assessment of Pattern Comparisons Between POD and Autoencoders in Intraventricular Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19376v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Surrogate-Augmented Symbolic CFD-Driven Training Framework for Accelerating Multi-objective Physical Model Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19031v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-driven training combines machine learning (ML) with CFD solvers to develop physically consistent closure models with improved predictive accuracy. In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[HydroGym: A Reinforcement Learning Platform for Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17534v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and controlling fluid flows is critical for several fields of science and engineering, including transportation, energy, and medicine. Effective flow control can lead to, e.g., lift increase, drag reduction, mixing enhancement, and noise reduction. However, controlling a fluid faces several significant challenges, including high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale interactions in space and time. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown great success in complex domains, such as robotics and protein folding, but its application to flow control is hindered by a lack of standardized benchmark platforms and the computational demands of fluid simulations. To address these challenges, we introduce HydroGym, a solver-independent RL platform for flow control research. HydroGym integrates sophisticated flow control benchmarks, scalable runtime infrastructure, and state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Our platform includes 42 validated environments spanning from canonical laminar flows to complex three-dimensional turbulent scenarios, validated over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We provide non-differentiable solvers for traditional RL and differentiable solvers that dramatically improve sample efficiency through gradient-enhanced optimization. Comprehensive evaluation reveals that RL agents consistently discover robust control principles across configurations, such as boundary layer manipulation, acoustic feedback disruption, and wake reorganization. Transfer learning studies demonstrate that controllers learned at one Reynolds number or geometry adapt efficiently to new conditions, requiring approximately 50% fewer training episodes. The HydroGym platform is highly extensible and scalable, providing a framework for researchers in fluid dynamics, machine learning, and control to add environments, surrogate models, and control algorithms to advance science and technology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Interferometer Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16051v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown tremendous promise in solving problems in high energy physics, materials science, and fluid dynamics. In this work, we introduce a new application for GNNs in the physical sciences: instrumentation design. As a case study, we apply GNNs to simulate models of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and show that they are capable of accurately capturing the complex optical physics at play, while achieving runtimes 815 times faster than state of the art simulation packages. We discuss the unique challenges this problem provides for machine learning models. In addition, we provide a dataset of high-fidelity optical physics simulations for three interferometer topologies, which can be used as a benchmarking suite for future work in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Particle Image Velocimetry Refinement via Consensus ADMM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11695v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is an imaging technique in experimental fluid dynamics that quantifies flow fields around bluff bodies by analyzing the displacement of neutrally buoyant tracer particles immersed in the fluid. Traditional PIV approaches typically depend on tuning parameters specific to the imaging setup, making the performance sensitive to variations in illumination, flow conditions, and seeding density. On the other hand, even state-of-the-art machine learning methods for flow quantification are fragile outside their training set. In our experiments, we observed that flow quantification would improve if different tunings (or algorithms) were applied to different regions of the same image pair. In this work, we parallelize the instantaneous flow quantification with multiple algorithms and adopt a consensus framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, seamlessly incorporating priors such as smoothness and incompressibility. We perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. For instance, we achieve a decrease in end-point-error of up to 20% of a dense-inverse-search estimator at an inference rate of 60Hz, and we show how this performance boost can be increased further with outlier rejection. Our method is implemented in JAX, effectively exploiting hardware acceleration, and integrated in Flow Gym, enabling (i) reproducible comparisons with the state-of-the-art, (ii) testing different base algorithms, (iii) straightforward deployment for active fluids control applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/antonioterpin/flowgym</p></details> |
| **[Machine Learning Framework for Thrombosis Risk Prediction in Rotary Blood Pumps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15761v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[FloraForge: LLM-Assisted Procedural Generation of Editable and Analysis-Ready 3D Plant Geometric Models For Agricultural Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11925v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D plant models are crucial for computational phenotyping and physics-based simulation; however, current approaches face significant limitations. Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD. The framework democratizes sophisticated geometric modeling for plant science while maintaining mathematical rigor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blood Pressure Prediction for Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis using Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10765v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |
| **[MFC 5.0: An exascale many-physics flow solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07953v4)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many problems of interest in engineering, medicine, and the fundamental sciences rely on high-fidelity flow simulation, making performant computational fluid dynamics solvers a mainstay of the open-source software community. Previous work, MFC 3.0, was published, documented, and made open-source by Bryngelson et al. CPC (2021) features numerous physical features, numerical methods, and scalable infrastructure. MFC 5.0 is a significant update to MFC 3.0, featuring a broad set of well-established and novel physical models and numerical methods, as well as the introduction of GPU and APU (or superchip) acceleration. We exhibit state-of-the-art performance and ideal scaling on the first two exascale supercomputers, OLCF's Frontier and LLNL's El Capitan. Combined with MFC's single-accelerator performance, MFC achieves exascale computation in practice and has achieved the largest-to-date public CFD simulation at 200 trillion grid points, earning it a 2025 ACM Gordon Bell Prize finalist. New physical features include the immersed boundary method, $N$-fluid phase change, Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange sub-grid bubble models, fluid-structure interaction, hypo- and hyper-elastic materials, chemically reacting flow, two-material surface tension, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and more. Numerical techniques now represent the current state-of-the-art, including general relaxation characteristic boundary conditions, WENO variants, Strang splitting for stiff sub-grid flow features, and low Mach number treatments. Weak scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs on OLCF's Summit and Frontier, and LLNL's El Capitan, achieves efficiencies within 5% of ideal to over 90% of their respective system sizes. Strong scaling results for a 16-fold increase in device count show parallel efficiencies exceeding 90% on OLCF Frontier.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

SynthPix supports the same configuration parameters as existing tools but achieves a throughput several orders of magnitude higher in image-pair generation per second. SynthPix was developed to enable the training of data-hungry reinforcement learning methods for flow estimation and for reducing the iteration times during the development of fast flow estimation methods used in recent active fluids control studies with real-time PIV feedback. We believe SynthPix to be useful for the fluid dynamics community, and in this paper we describe the main ideas behind this software package.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/antonioterpin/synthpix</p></details> |
| **[Rates and architectures for learning geometrically non-trivial operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09376v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods have proven capable of recovering operators between high-dimensional spaces, such as solution maps of PDEs and similar objects in mathematical physics, from very few training samples. This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Graph Deep Learning for Intracranial Aneurysm Blood Flow Simulation and Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09013v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intracranial aneurysms remain a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality worldwide, where rupture risk is tightly coupled to local hemodynamics particularly wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index. Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive. We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields. This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system. Our full pipeline delivers high-resolution hemodynamic predictions within minutes of patient imaging, without requiring computational specialists, marking a step-change toward real-time, bedside aneurysm analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Urban Flow Modeling: From Geometry to Airflow with Graph Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14725v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow modeling and simulation play an important role in air quality assessment and sustainable city planning. A key challenge for modeling and simulation is handling the complex geometries of the urban landscape. Low order models are limited in capturing the effects of geometry, while high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are prohibitively expensive, especially across multiple geometries or wind conditions. Here, we propose a generative diffusion framework for synthesizing steady-state urban wind fields over unstructured meshes that requires only geometry information. The framework combines a hierarchical graph neural network with score-based diffusion modeling to generate accurate and diverse velocity fields without requiring temporal rollouts or dense measurements. Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions. Ablation studies confirm robustness to mesh variation and performance under different inference regimes. This work develops is the first step towards foundation models for the built environment that can help urban planners rapidly evaluate design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViSA: 3D-Aware Video Shading for Real-Time Upper-Body Avatar Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07720v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-fidelity upper-body 3D avatars from one-shot input image remains a significant challenge. Current 3D avatar generation methods, which rely on large reconstruction models, are fast and capable of producing stable body structures, but they often suffer from artifacts such as blurry textures and stiff, unnatural motion. In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

| **[CFD-copilot: leveraging domain-adapted large language model and model context protocol to enhance simulation automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07917v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations requires significant expertise in physics modeling and numerical methods, posing a barrier to non-specialists. Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements. We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing. The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups. A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution. This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis. The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil. The results indicate that domain-specific adaptation and the incorporation of the MCP jointly enhance the reliability and efficiency of LLM-driven engineering workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction with Physics-Informed Machine Learning and Immersed Boundary Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18565v5)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, yet their application to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with moving boundaries remains largely unexplored. This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with moving interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the Multi-Scale Patch Transformer (MSPT), an architecture that combines local point attention within patches with global attention to coarse patch-level representations. To partition the input domain into spatially-coherent patches, we employ ball trees, which handle irregular geometries efficiently. This dual-scale design enables MSPT to scale to millions of points on a single GPU. We validate our method on standard PDE benchmarks (elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, porous flow) and large-scale aerodynamic datasets (ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower memory footprint and computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation: A Perspective from Computational Fluid Dynamics Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01319v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise segmentation of intracranial aneurysms and their parent vessels (IA-Vessel) is a critical step for hemodynamic analyses, which mainly depends on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes. The dataset, code, and model will be public available at https://github.com/AbsoluteResonance/IAVS.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional studies often miss the link between neuromuscular control and whole-body movement. To explore energy transfer in carangiform swimming, we created a bio-inspired digital trout. This model combined multibody dynamics, Hill-type muscle modeling, and a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction algorithm, accurately replicating a real trout's form and properties. Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation. Moderate muscle contraction duration ([0.1,0.3] of a tail-beat cycle) lets the body and fluid act as a passive damping system, cutting energy use. Additionally, the activation phase lag of myomeres shapes the body wave; if too large, it causes antagonistic contractions that hinder thrust. These findings advance bio-inspired locomotion understanding and aid energy-efficient underwater system design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization Framework for CFD-Based Non-Premixed Burner Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23140v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MF-BO) framework that integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluations with Gaussian-process surrogates to efficiently navigate the accuracy-cost trade-off induced by mesh resolution. The design vector x = [h, l, s] (height, length, and mesh element size) defines a continuous fidelity index Z(h, l, s), enabling the optimizer to adaptively combine low- and high-resolution simulations. This framework is applied to a non-premixed burner configuration targeting improved thermal efficiency under hydrogen-enriched fuels. A calibrated runtime model t_hat(h, l, s) penalizes computationally expensive queries, while a constrained noisy expected improvement (qNEI) guides sampling under an emissions cap of 2e-6 for NOx. Surrogates trained on CFD data exhibit stable hyperparameters and physically consistent sensitivities: mean temperature increases with reactor length and fidelity and is weakly negative with height; NOx grows with temperature yet tends to decrease with length. The best design achieves T_bar approx 2.0e3 K while satisfying the NOx limit. Relative to a hypothetical single-fidelity campaign (Z = 1), the MF-BO achieves comparable convergence with about 57 percent lower total wall time by learning the design landscape through fast low-Z evaluations and reserving high-Z CFD for promising candidates. Overall, the methodology offers a generalizable and computationally affordable path for optimizing reacting-flow systems in which mesh-driven fidelity inherently couples accuracy, cost, and emissions. This highlights its potential to accelerate design cycles and reduce resource requirements in industrial burner development and other high-cost CFD-driven applications.</p></details> |  |

Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems.

| **[Resolving Sharp Gradients of Unstable Singularities to Machine Precision via Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22819v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work introduced a robust computational framework combining embedded mathematical structures, advanced optimization, and neural network architecture, leading to the discovery of multiple unstable self-similar solutions for key fluid dynamics equations, including the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and 2D Boussinesq systems. While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D Córdoba-Córdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 12 figures |

However, building accurate surrogate models still requires a large number of expensive simulations. To address this challenge, we introduce epsilon HQS, a scalable active learning strategy that leverages a student teacher framework to train deep neural networks efficiently. Unlike Bayesian AL methods, which are computationally demanding with DNNs, epsilon HQS selectively queries informative samples to reduce labeling cost. Applied to CFD, FEA, and propeller design tasks, our method achieves higher accuracy under fixed labeling cost budgets.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16417v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[CompARE: A Computational framework for Airborne Respiratory disease Evaluation integrating flow physics and human behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21782v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The risk of indoor airborne transmission among co-located individuals is generally non-uniform, which remains a critical challenge for public health modelling. Thus, we present CompARE, an integrated risk assessment framework for indoor airborne disease transmission that reveals a striking bimodal distribution of infection risk driven by airflow dynamics and human behavior. Combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD), machine learning (ML), and agent-based modeling (ABM), our model captures the complex interplay between aerosol transport, human mobility, and environmental context. Based on a prototypical childcare center, our approach quantifies how incorporation of ABM can unveil significantly different infection risk profiles across agents, with more than two-fold change in risk of infection between the individuals with the lowest and highest risks in more than 90% of cases, despite all individuals being in the same overall environment. We found that infection risk distributions can exhibit not only a striking bimodal pattern in certain activities but also exponential decay and fat-tailed behavior in others. Specifically, we identify low-risk modes arising from source containment, as well as high-risk tails from prolonged close contact. Our approach enables near-real-time scenario analysis and provides policy-relevant quantitative insights into how ventilation design, spatial layout, and social distancing policies can mitigate transmission risk. These findings challenge simple distance-based heuristics and support the design of targeted, evidence-based interventions in high-occupancy indoor settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamics-Informed Gaussian Process Framework for 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes via Quasi-Gaussianity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21281v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent proof of quasi-Gaussianity for the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes (SNS) equations by Coe, Hairer, and Tolomeo establishes that the system's unique invariant measure is equivalent (mutually absolutely continuous) to the Gaussian measure of its corresponding linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Neural Surrogates on High-Fidelity 3D Car Aerodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07847v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking has been the cornerstone of progress in computer vision, natural language processing, and the broader deep learning domain, driving algorithmic innovation through standardized datasets and reproducible evaluation protocols. The growing availability of large-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets has opened new opportunities for applying machine learning to aerodynamic and engineering design. Yet, despite this progress, there exists no standardized benchmark for large-scale numerical simulations in engineering design. In this work, we introduce CarBench, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to large-scale 3D car aerodynamics, performing a large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art models on DrivAerNet++, the largest public dataset for automotive aerodynamics, containing over 8,000 high-fidelity car simulations. We assess eleven architectures spanning neural operator methods (e.g., Fourier Neural Operator), geometric deep learning (PointNet, RegDGCNN, PointMAE, PointTransformer), transformer-based neural solvers (Transolver, Transolver++, AB-UPT), and implicit field networks (TripNet). Beyond standard interpolation tasks, we perform cross-category experiments in which transformer-based solvers trained on a single car archetype are evaluated on unseen categories. Our analysis covers predictive accuracy, physical consistency, computational efficiency, and statistical uncertainty. To accelerate progress in data-driven engineering, we open-source the benchmark framework, including training pipelines, uncertainty estimation routines based on bootstrap resampling, and pretrained model weights, establishing the first reproducible foundation for large-scale learning from high-fidelity CFD simulations, available at https://github.com/Mohamedelrefaie/CarBench.</p></details> |  |

While 3D coronary artery digital twins reconstructed from imaging offer detailed anatomy for personalized assessment, their analysis relies on computationally intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD), limiting scalability. Data-driven approaches are hindered by scarce labeled data and lack of physiological priors. To address this, we present PINS-CAD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework. It pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins to predict pressure and flow, guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, eliminating the need for CFD or labeled data. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations. Furthermore, PINS-CAD generates spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable biomarkers. By embedding physical priors into geometric deep learning, PINS-CAD transforms routine angiography into a simulation-free, physiology-aware framework for scalable, preventive cardiology.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic Regression (SR) offers an interpretable alternative to conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, which are often criticized as ``black boxes''. In contrast to standard regression models that require a prescribed functional form, SR constructs expressions from a user-defined set of mathematical primitives, enabling the automated discovery of compact formulas that fit the data and reveal underlying physical relationships. In fluid mechanics, where understanding the underlying physics is as crucial as predictive accuracy, this study applies SR to model three-dimensional (3D) laminar flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the axial velocity and pressure fields. Compact symbolic equations were derived from numerical simulation data, accurately reproducing the expected parabolic velocity profile and linear pressure drop, and showing excellent agreement with analytical solutions from the literature. To address the limitation that purely data-driven SR models may overlook domain-specific constraints, an innovative hybrid framework that integrates SR with Answer Set Programming (ASP) is also introduced. This integration combines the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning capabilities of ASP, ensuring that derived equations remain both statistically accurate and physically plausible. The proposed SR/ASP methodology demonstrates the potential of combining data-driven and knowledge-representation approaches to enhance interpretability, reliability, and alignment with physical principles in fluid dynamics and related domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research was implemented in the framework of the Action "Flagship actions in interdisciplinary scientific fields with a special focus on the productive fabric'', which is implemented through the National Recovery and Resilience Fund Greece 2.0 and funded by the European Union--NextGenerationEU (Project ID: TAEDR-0535983)</p></details> |
| **[FunDiff: Diffusion Models over Function Spaces for Physics-Informed Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07902v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce $\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and low-resolution data.

| **[Predicting partially observable dynamical systems via diffusion models with a multiscale inference scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19390v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[When do World Models Successfully Learn Dynamical Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04898v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore the use of compact latent representations with learned time dynamics ('World Models') to simulate physical systems. Drawing on concepts from control theory, we propose a theoretical framework that explains why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Mesh-Quantization for Neural PDE Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18474v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems commonly exhibit spatially varying complexity, presenting a significant challenge for neural PDE solvers. While Graph Neural Networks can handle the irregular meshes required for complex geometries and boundary conditions, they still apply uniform computational effort across all nodes regardless of the underlying physics complexity. This leads to inefficient resource allocation where computationally simple regions receive the same treatment as complex phenomena. We address this challenge by introducing Adaptive Mesh Quantization: spatially adaptive quantization across mesh node, edge, and cluster features, dynamically adjusting the bit-width used by a quantized model. We propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy driven by a lightweight auxiliary model that identifies high-loss regions in the input mesh. This enables dynamic resource distribution in the main model, where regions of higher difficulty are allocated increased bit-width, optimizing computational resource utilization. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness by integrating it with two state-of-the-art models, MP-PDE and GraphViT, to evaluate performance across multiple tasks: 2D Darcy flow, large-scale unsteady fluid dynamics in 2D, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations in 3D, and a 2D hyper-elasticity problem. Our framework demonstrates consistent Pareto improvements over uniformly quantized baselines, yielding up to 50% improvements in performance at the same cost.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics, a data-driven nonlinear model reduction framework to build a low-dimensional surrogate model for complex evolution systems. Given time-dependent training data, we split the time domain into multiple overlapping windows, within which nonlinear dimension reduction is performed by auto-encoders to capture latent codes. Once a low-dimensional representation of the data is learned, a propagator network is trained to capture the evolution of the latent codes in each window, and a transcoder is trained to connect the latent codes between adjacent windows. The proposed windowed decomposition significantly simplifies propagator training by breaking long-horizon dynamics into multiple short, manageable segments, while the transcoders ensure consistency across windows. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we develop a mathematical theory establishing the representation power of WeldNet under the manifold hypothesis, justifying the success of nonlinear model reduction via deep autoencoder-based architectures. Our numerical experiments on various differential equations indicate that WeldNet can capture nonlinear latent structures and their underlying dynamics, outperforming both traditional projection-based approaches and recently developed nonlinear model reduction methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited hardware resources on today's mobile platforms hinder these applications, as they struggle to achieve real-time performance. In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices. Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\times$ speedup and 32.3\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Convex-Inspired Neural Construction for Structured and Generalizable Nonlinear Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18241v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time simulation of deformable objects relies on model reduction to achieve interactive performance while maintaining physical fidelity. Traditional linear methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), provide structured and predictable behavior thanks to their linear formulation, but are limited in expressiveness. Nonlinear model reduction, typically implemented with neural networks, offers richer representations and higher compression; however, without structural constraints, the learned mappings often fail to generalize beyond the training distribution, leading to unstable or implausible deformations. We present a symmetric, convex-inspired neural formulation that bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear model reduction. Our approach adopts an input-convex neural network (ICNN) augmented with symmetry constraints to impose structure on the nonlinear decoder. This design retains the flexibility of neural mappings while embedding physical consistency, yielding coherent and stable displacements even under unseen conditions. We evaluate our method on challenging deformation scenarios involving forces of different magnitudes, inverse directions, and sparsely sampled training data. Our approach demonstrates superior generalization while maintaining compact reduced spaces, and supports real-time interactive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</p></details> | 28 pages, 19 figures |

However, effective dynamic shape control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 8 Figures |

The Kempf-Ness theorem is used to establish that the $L^2$ regularizer is minimized on the balanced manifold. This allows us to decompose the training dynamics into two distinct gradient flows: a regularizing flow on fibers and a learning flow on the balanced manifold. We show that the regularizing flow is exactly solvable using the moment map. This approach provides a common mathematical framework for balancedness in deep learning and linear systems theory. We use this framework to interpret balancedness in terms of model reduction and Bayesian principles.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

A key challenge is that ensemble-based approaches can become prohibitively expensive when embedded in control and data assimilation loops in digital twins, even when reduced models are used. We introduce a reduced modeling approach that advances in time the mean and covariance of the reduced solution distribution induced by the initial condition uncertainties, which eliminates the need to maintain and propagate a costly ensemble of reduced solutions. The mean and covariance dynamics are obtained as a moment closure from Neural Galerkin schemes on pre-trained neural networks, which can be interpreted as filtered Neural Galerkin dynamics analogous to Gaussian filtering and the extended Kalman filter. Numerical experiments demonstrate that filtered Neural Galerkin schemes achieve more than one order of magnitude speedup compared to ensemble-based uncertainty propagation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Interpretable Deep Learning and Analysis of Dynamical Systems via the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21852v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18636v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.</p></details> | 10 pages, BMVC2025 |

In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16509v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Flash Thinking via Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15374v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Since...</summary><p>Since the article needs improvement, it will be temporarily withdrawn</p></details> |

Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |

However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The "space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06608v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</p></details> | 62 pages, 26 figures |

From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</p></details> |  |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |

The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and the energy-conserving sampling and weighting method (ECSW) are extended to account for the multi-field nature of the problem. Both methods yield stable reduced order simulations, while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to full-order simulations. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and limitations of the proposed approaches. The decomposed ECSW method has overall higher accuracy and lower computational cost than the decomposed DEIM method.</p></details> |  |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Kernel-Based Sparse Additive Nonlinear Model Structure Detection through a Linearization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01453v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction error alone.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.</p></details> |  |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.02273</p></details> |

| **[Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552v7)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To explore the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and to probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of emulators of multiscale systems to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) the choice of an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. These insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific goals, processes, and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application by developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. Overall, these results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory providing a principled framework to guide model design and enhance causal understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Critical Assessment of Pattern Comparisons Between POD and Autoencoders in Intraventricular Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19376v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

It promises to drastically reduce expensive numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling. Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, SPIGM workshop at NeurIPS 2025, https://openreview.net/forum?id=IT9lF59UqG&noteId=IT9lF59UqG</p></details> |

Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.</p></details> |  |

Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.</p></details> | 38 pages, 14 figures |

In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Updating of constitutive parameters under hybrid uncertainties with a novel surrogate model applied to biofilms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15145v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of bacterial biofilm growth is essential for understanding their complex dynamics in biomedical, environmental, and industrial settings. These dynamics are shaped by a variety of environmental influences, including the presence of antibiotics, nutrient availability, and inter-species interactions, all of which affect species-specific growth rates. However, capturing this behavior in computational models is challenging due to the presence of hybrid uncertainties, a combination of epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete knowledge about model parameters) and aleatory uncertainty (reflecting inherent biological variability and stochastic environmental conditions). In this work, we present a Bayesian model updating (BMU) framework to calibrate a recently introduced multi-species biofilm growth model. To enable efficient inference in the presence of hybrid uncertainties, we construct a reduced-order model (ROM) derived using the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) approach. TSM allows for an efficient propagation of aleatory uncertainty, which enables single-loop Bayesian inference, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive nested (double-loop) schemes typically required in hybrid uncertainty quantification. The BMU framework employs a likelihood function constructed from the mean and variance of stochastic model outputs, enabling robust parameter calibration even under sparse and noisy data. We validate our approach through two case studies: a two-species and a four-species biofilm model. Both demonstrate that our method not only accurately recovers the underlying model parameters but also provides predictive responses consistent with the synthetic data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced Order Modeling of Energetic Materials Using Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks in a Latent Space (LatentPARC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12401v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Accuracy and Speed: A Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter with a Machine Learning Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12276v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, more and more machine learning (ML) surrogates are being developed for computationally expensive physical models. In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography.</p></details> |  |

These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Time Extrapolation with Graph Convolutional Autoencoder and Tensor Train Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23037v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph autoencoders have gained attention in nonlinear reduced-order modeling of parameterized partial differential equations defined on unstructured grids. Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operator Learning at Machine Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19980v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.</p></details> |  |

The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by Applied Energy</p></details> |

This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

Existing approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (ML4PS). 12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Learning Stochastic Multiscale Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22655v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly from observational data. Drawing inspiration from physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, we resolve the macroscale state on a coarse mesh while introducing a microscale latent state to explicitly model unresolved dynamics. We learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a simulator-free amortized variational inference method with a Product of Experts likelihood that enforces scale separation. We present detailed numerical studies to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive accuracy compared to under-resolved direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at equivalent resolution, as well as reduced-order modeling approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</p></details> | 28 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v5)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Experiments were carried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under both irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under investigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses due to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven reduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring loads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of vessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware characterization of the model response by accounting for variability in hyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated that both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular and irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based ROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification, demonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea condition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in reproducing vessel dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, 1 box</p></details> |

However, their opaque inner workings often constitute an obstacle to physical interpretability. This work introduces Hierarchical Fourier Neural Operators (HFNOs), a novel FNO-based architecture tailored for reduced-order modeling of turbulent fluid flows, designed to enhance interpretability by explicitly separating fluid behavior across scales. The proposed architecture processes wavenumber bins in parallel, enabling the approximation of dispersion relations and non-linear interactions. Inputs are lifted to a higher-dimensional space, Fourier-transformed, and partitioned into wavenumber bins. Each bin is processed by a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), with outputs subsequently padded, summed, and inverse-transformed back into physical space. A final transformation refines the output in physical space as a correction model, by means of one of the following architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Echo State Network (ESN). We evaluate the proposed model on a series of increasingly complex dynamical systems: first on the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, then on the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and finally on the prediction of wall shear stress in turbulent channel flow, given the near-wall velocity field. In all test cases, the model demonstrates its ability to decompose turbulent flows across various scales, opening up the possibility of increased interpretability and multiscale modeling of such flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Simulations of nonlinear structures, such as soft-bodied robots modeled using the finite element method (FEM), often demand substantial computational resources, especially during optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel optimization algorithm based on a tensorial parametric reduced order model (PROM). Our algorithm leverages dimensionality reduction and solution approximation techniques to facilitate efficient solving of nonlinear constrained optimization problems. The well-structured tensorial approach enables the use of analytical gradients within a specifically chosen reduced order basis (ROB), significantly enhancing computational efficiency. To showcase the performance of our method, we apply it to optimizing soft robotic swimmer shapes. These actuated soft robots experience hydrodynamic forces, subjecting them to both internal and external nonlinear forces, which are incorporated into our optimization process using a data-free ROB for fast and accurate computations. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also unlocks new opportunities to optimize complex nonlinear systems in soft robotics, paving the way for more efficient design and control.</p></details> |  |

Unlike data-driven approaches, this method operates directly on the governing equations, eliminating the need for full-order simulations. The proposed model is computed at a single value of the bifurcation parameter yet remains valid over a range of values. The approach systematically constructs an invariant manifold and embedded dynamics, providing an accurate and efficient reduction of the original system. The ability to capture pre-critical steady states, the bifurcation point, and post-critical limit cycle oscillations is demonstrated by a strong agreement between the reduced order model and full order simulations, while achieving significant computational speed-up.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed Reduced Order Modeling of Time-dependent PDEs via Differentiable Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14595v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order modeling (ROM) of time-dependent and parameterized differential equations aims to accelerate the simulation of complex high-dimensional systems by learning a compact latent manifold representation that captures the characteristics of the solution fields and their time-dependent dynamics. Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($Φ$-ROM) by incorporating differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters, enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore, $Φ$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework's robustness across various PDE solvers and highlight its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX implementation that is readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable solvers, available at https://phi-rom.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We extend the PROM-ANN architecture by complementing snapshot-based training with a FEM-based, discrete physics-informed residual loss, bridging the gap between traditional projection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Unlike conventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM residuals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key contributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss applicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to PROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an empirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs. The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem, simulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment in regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on non-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining reasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of magnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation is not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the application of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap between data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the untapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM development. This work underscores the critical role of FEM residuals in ROM construction and calls for further exploration on architectures beyond PROM-ANN.</p></details> |  |

Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

We utilize this framework to parameterize the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation model, incorporating immobile phase exchange through a memory function. We solve the governing equation analytically in the Laplace domain and numerically invert it to generate synthetic breakthrough curves for different memory functions and boundary conditions. A dimensionless formulation enables decoupling the estimation of advection velocity from other parameters, significantly reducing the number of required forward solutions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion to transform the synthetic dataset into a reduced-order space. Given a measured breakthrough curve, we estimate the advection velocity by minimizing the distance from the measurement to the synthetic data in KL space, and infer the remaining dimensionless parameters by Projected Barycentric Interpolation (PBI). We benchmark our method against several alternatives, including Laplace domain fitting, moment matching, global random optimization, and variations of the DSTE framework using nearest-neighbor interpolation and neural network-based estimation. Applied to 295 breakthrough curves from 54 tracer tests in 25 rivers, DSTE delivers accurate parameter estimates. The resulting labeled dataset allows researchers to link transport parameters with hydraulic conditions, site characteristics, and measured concentrations. The synthetic dataset can be leveraged for the analysis of new breakthrough curves, eliminating the need for additional forward simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Water Resources Research</p></details> |

To overcome these difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks, to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro- and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time scales present in the phenomena under study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regul...</summary><p>Regular research article, 28 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |

In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.</p></details> |  |

Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 page appendix</p></details> |

| **[Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552v7)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To explore the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and to probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of emulators of multiscale systems to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) the choice of an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. These insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific goals, processes, and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application by developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. Overall, these results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory providing a principled framework to guide model design and enhance causal understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[4D Gaussian Splatting as a Learned Dynamical System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19648v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We reinterpret 4D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous-time dynamical system, where scene motion arises from integrating a learned neural dynamical field rather than applying per-frame deformations. This formulation, which we call EvoGS, treats the Gaussian representation as an evolving physical system whose state evolves continuously under a learned motion law. This unlocks capabilities absent in deformation-based approaches:(1) sample-efficient learning from sparse temporal supervision by modeling the underlying motion law; (2) temporal extrapolation enabling forward and backward prediction beyond observed time ranges; and (3) compositional dynamics that allow localized dynamics injection for controllable scene synthesis. Experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks show that EvoGS achieves better motion coherence and temporal consistency compared to deformation-field baselines while maintaining real-time rendering</p></details> |  |
| **[An Inverse Scattering Inspired Fourier Neural Operator for Time-Dependent PDE Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19439v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning accurate and stable time-advancement operators for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging, particularly for chaotic, stiff, and long-horizon dynamical systems. While neural operator methods such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Koopman-inspired extensions achieve good short-term accuracy, their long-term stability is often limited by unconstrained latent representations and cumulative rollout errors. In this work, we introduce an inverse scattering inspired Fourier Neural Operator(IS-FNO), motivated by the reversibility and spectral evolution structure underlying the classical inverse scattering transform. The proposed architecture enforces a near-reversible pairing between lifting and projection maps through an explicitly invertible neural transformation, and models latent temporal evolution using exponential Fourier layers that naturally encode linear and nonlinear spectral dynamics. We systematically evaluate IS-FNO against baseline FNO and Koopman-based models on a range of benchmark PDEs, including the Michelson-Sivashinsky and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (in one and two dimensions), as well as the integrable Korteweg-de Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The results demonstrate that IS-FNO achieves lower short-term errors and substantially improved long-horizon stability in non-stiff regimes. For integrable systems, reduced IS-FNO variants that embed analytical scattering structure retain competitive long-term accuracy despite limited model capacity. Overall, this work shows that incorporating physical structure -- particularly reversibility and spectral evolution -- into neural operator design significantly enhances robustness and long-term predictive fidelity for nonlinear PDE dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Research Program: Theory of Learning in Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19410v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern learning systems increasingly interact with data that evolve over time and depend on hidden internal state. We ask a basic question: when is such a dynamical system learnable from observations alone? This paper proposes a research program for understanding learnability in dynamical systems through the lens of next-token prediction. We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attractor learning for spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems using echo state networks with transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24099v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore the predictive capabilities of echo state networks (ESNs) for the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (gKS) equation, an archetypal nonlinear PDE that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos. Our research focuses on predicting changes in long-term statistical patterns of the gKS model that result from varying the dispersion relation or the length of the spatial domain. We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor. Previous work has shown that transfer learning can be used effectively with ESNs for single-orbit prediction. The novelty of our paper lies in our use of this pairing to predict the long-term statistical properties of spatiotemporally chaotic PDEs. We also show that transfer learning nontrivially improves the length of time that predictions of individual gKS trajectories remain accurate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Merge on workspaces as Hopf algebra Markov chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18861v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the dynamical properties of a Hopf algebra Markov chain with state space the binary rooted forests with labelled leaves. This Markovian dynamical system describes the core computational process of structure formation and transformation in syntax via the Merge operation, according to Chomsky's Minimalism model of generative linguistics. The dynamics decomposes into an ergodic dynamical system with uniform stationary distribution, given by the action of Internal Merge, while the contributions of External Merge and (a minimal form of) Sideward Merge reduce to a simpler Markov chain with state space the set of partitions and with combinatorial weights. The Sideward Merge part of the dynamics prevents convergence to fully formed connected structures (trees), unless the different forms of Merge are weighted by a cost function, as predicted by linguistic theory. Results on the asymptotic behavior of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue and eigenvector in this weighted case, obtained in terms of an associated Perron-Frobenius problem in the tropical semiring, show that the usual cost functions (Minimal Search and Resource Restrictions) proposed in the linguistic literature do not suffice to obtain convergence to the tree structures, while an additional optimization property based on the Shannon entropy achieves the expected result for the dynamics. We also comment on the introduction of continuous parameters related to semantic embedding and other computational models, and also on some filtering of the dynamics by coloring rules that model the linguistic filtering by theta roles and phase structure, and on parametric variation and the process of parameter setting in Externalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>80 pa...</summary><p>80 pages, LaTeX, 1 png figure</p></details> |
| **[The Universe Learning Itself: On the Evolution of Dynamics from the Big Bang to Machine Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16515v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a unified, dynamical-systems narrative of the universe that traces a continuous chain of structure formation from the Big Bang to contemporary human societies and their artificial learning systems. Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories.</p></details> | 38 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Comparing Dynamical Models Through Diffeomorphic Vector Field Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18566v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly popular in theoretical neuroscience for hypothesis-generation and data analysis. Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>57 pa...</summary><p>57 pages, 18 figures.

| **[ASPEN: An Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network for Ginzburg-Landau Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03290v3)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Neural Proofs for Sound Verification and Control of Complex Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18389v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This informal contribution presents an ongoing line of research that is pursuing a new approach to the construction of sound proofs for the formal verification and control of complex stochastic models of dynamical systems, of reactive programs and, more generally, of models of Cyber-Physical Systems. Neural proofs are made up of two key components: 1) proof rules encode requirements entailing the verification of general temporal specifications over the models of interest; and 2) certificates that discharge such rules, namely they are constructed from said proof rules with an inductive (that is, cyclic, repetitive) approach; this inductive approach involves: 2a) accessing samples from the model's dynamics and accordingly training neural networks, whilst 2b) generalising such networks via SAT-modulo-theory (SMT) queries that leverage the full knowledge of the models. In the context of sequential decision making problems over complex stochastic models, it is possible to additionally generate provably-correct policies/strategies/controllers, namely state-feedback functions that, in conjunction with neural certificates, formally attain the given specifications for the models of interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Efficient Adjustment in Causal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18315v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observational studies in fields such as epidemiology often rely on covariate adjustment to estimate causal effects. Classical graphical criteria, like the back-door criterion and the generalized adjustment criterion, are powerful tools for identifying valid adjustment sets in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, these criteria are not directly applicable to summary causal graphs (SCGs), which are abstractions of DAGs commonly used in dynamic systems. In SCGs, each node typically represents an entire time series and may involve cycles, making classical criteria inapplicable for identifying causal effects. Recent work established complete conditions for determining whether the micro causal effect of a treatment or an exposure $X_{t-γ}$ on an outcome $Y_t$ is identifiable via covariate adjustment in SCGs, under the assumption of no hidden confounding. However, these identifiability conditions have two main limitations. First, they are complex, relying on cumbersome definitions and requiring the enumeration of multiple paths in the SCG, which can be computationally expensive. Second, when these conditions are satisfied, they only provide two valid adjustment sets, limiting flexibility in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an equivalent but simpler formulation of those identifiability conditions and introduce a new criterion that identifies a broader class of valid adjustment sets in SCGs. Additionally, we characterize the quasi-optimal adjustment set among these, i.e., the one that minimizes the asymptotic variance of the causal effect estimator. Our contributions offer both theoretical advancement and practical tools for more flexible and efficient causal inference in abstracted causal graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximation and learning with compositional tensor trains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18059v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce compositional tensor trains (CTTs) for the approximation of multivariate functions, a class of models obtained by composing low-rank functions in the tensor-train format. This format can encode standard approximation tools, such as (sparse) polynomials, deep neural networks (DNNs) with fixed width, or tensor networks with arbitrary permutation of the inputs, or more general affine coordinate transformations, with similar complexities. This format can be viewed as a DNN with width exponential in the input dimension and structured weights matrices. Compared to DNNs, this format enables controlled compression at the layer level using efficient tensor algebra. On the optimization side, we derive a layerwise algorithm inspired by natural gradient descent, allowing to exploit efficient low-rank tensor algebra. This relies on low-rank estimations of Gram matrices, and tensor structured random sketching. Viewing the format as a discrete dynamical system, we also derive an optimization algorithm inspired by numerical methods in optimal control. Numerical experiments on regression tasks demonstrate the expressivity of the new format and the relevance of the proposed optimization algorithms. Overall, CTTs combine the expressivity of compositional models with the algorithmic efficiency of tensor algebra, offering a scalable alternative to standard deep neural networks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Neural CDEs as Correctors for Learned Time Series Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12116v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned time-series models, whether continuous- or discrete-time, are widely used to forecast the states of a dynamical system. Such models generate multi-step forecasts either directly, by predicting the full horizon at once, or iteratively, by feeding back their own predictions at each step. In both cases, the multi-step forecasts are prone to errors. To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training. We evaluate our Corrector with diverse Predictors, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations, Contiformer, and DLinear, on synthetic, physics simulation, and real-world forecasting datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the Predictor-Corrector mechanism consistently improves the performance compared to Predictor alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven particle dynamics: Structure-preserving coarse-graining for emergent behavior in non-equilibrium systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12569v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</p></details> | 39 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Distributionally Robust Imitation Learning: Layered Control Architecture for Certifiable Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17899v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) enables autonomous behavior by learning from expert demonstrations. While more sample-efficient than comparative alternatives like reinforcement learning, IL is sensitive to compounding errors induced by distribution shifts. There are two significant sources of distribution shifts when using IL-based feedback laws on systems: distribution shifts caused by policy error and distribution shifts due to exogenous disturbances and endogenous model errors due to lack of learning. Our previously developed approaches, Taylor Series Imitation Learning (TaSIL) and $\mathcal{L}_1$ -Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control (\ellonedrac), address the challenge of distribution shifts in complementary ways. While TaSIL offers robustness against policy error-induced distribution shifts, \ellonedrac offers robustness against distribution shifts due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. To enable certifiable IL for learned and/or uncertain dynamical systems, we formulate \textit{Distributionally Robust Imitation Policy (DRIP)} architecture, a Layered Control Architecture (LCA) that integrates TaSIL and~\ellonedrac. By judiciously designing individual layer-centric input and output requirements, we show how we can guarantee certificates for the entire control pipeline. Our solution paves the path for designing fully certifiable autonomy pipelines, by integrating learning-based components, such as perception, with certifiable model-based decision-making through the proposed LCA approach.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Systems-Theoretic View on the Convergence of Algorithms under Disturbances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17598v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithms increasingly operate within complex physical, social, and engineering systems where they are exposed to disturbances, noise, and interconnections with other dynamical systems. This article extends known convergence guarantees of an algorithm operating in isolation (i.e., without disturbances) and systematically derives stability bounds and convergence rates in the presence of such disturbances. By leveraging converse Lyapunov theorems, we derive key inequalities that quantify the impact of disturbances. We further demonstrate how our result can be utilized to assess the effects of disturbances on algorithmic performance in a wide variety of applications, including communication constraints in distributed learning, sensitivity in machine learning generalization, and intentional noise injection for privacy. This underpins the role of our result as a unifying tool for algorithm analysis in the presence of noise, disturbances, and interconnections with other dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASecond-Order SpikingSSM for Wearables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14386v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks have garnered increasing attention due to their energy efficiency, multiplication-free computation, and sparse event-based processing. In parallel, state space models have emerged as scalable alternatives to transformers for long-range sequence modelling by avoiding quadratic dependence on sequence length. We propose SHaRe-SSM (Spiking Harmonic Resonate-and-Fire State Space Model), a second-order spiking SSM for classification and regression on ultra-long sequences. SHaRe-SSM outperforms transformers and first-order SSMs on average while eliminating matrix multiplications, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained applications. To ensure fast computation over tens of thousands of time steps, we leverage a parallel scan formulation of the underlying dynamical system. Furthermore, we introduce a kernel-based spiking regressor, which enables the accurate modelling of dependencies in sequences of up to 50k steps. Our results demonstrate that SHaRe-SSM achieves superior long-range modelling capability with energy efficiency (52.1x less than ANN-based second order SSM), positioning it as a strong candidate for resource-constrained devices such as wearables</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning solution operator of dynamical systems with diffusion maps kernel ridge regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17203v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many scientific and engineering systems exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics that are difficult to predict accurately over long time horizons. Although data-driven models have shown promise, their performance often deteriorates when the geometric structures governing long-term behavior are unknown or poorly represented. We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection. Together, simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance point to a promising path for reliable and efficient learning of complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thermodynamics a la Souriau on Kähler Non Compact Symmetric Spaces for Cartan Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16772v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we clarify several issues concerning the abstract geometrical formulation of thermodynamics on non compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$ that are the mathematical model of hidden layers in the new paradigm of Cartan Neural Networks. We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {à} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the Kähler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\subset\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\mathbb{H}\subset\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincaré and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\mathrm{U}$. The partition function is invariant against $\mathrm{U}$ transformations and the set of its arguments, namely the generalized temperatures, can be always reduced to a minimal set whose cardinality is equal to the rank of the compact denominator group $\mathrm{H}\subset \mathrm{U}$.</p></details> | 108 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Pattern recognition in complex systems via vector-field representations of spatio-temporal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16763v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Gated KalmaNet: A Fading Memory Layer Through Test-Time Ridge Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21016v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear State-Space Models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall-oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that accounts for the full past while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. We ground our approach in the Kalman Filter (KF) framework, which provides a principled solution for optimal inference in dynamical systems. We show that several existing SSM layers (DeltaNet, Gated DeltaNet, and Kimi Delta Attention) are approximations to the KF recurrence that assume identity error covariance, thereby ignoring how past measurements (keys and values) should optimally influence state updates. In contrast, GKA computes the exact Kalman gain by maintaining the full error covariance. Under a steady-state assumption that enables parallelization, this reduces to solving an online ridge regression problem with constant memory and linear compute cost. A critical insight is that standard KF equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and hard to parallelize on modern hardware. We address this through: (1) adaptive regularization with input-dependent gating to control the condition number of the ridge regression for numerical stability, and (2) Chebyshev Iteration, which we show is more stable than conventional iterative solvers in low-precision settings. We further develop hardware-aware chunk-wise kernels to enable efficient training. Empirically, GKA outperforms existing SSM layers (like Mamba2 and Gated DeltaNet) on short-context tasks and achieves more than 10\% relative improvement on long-context RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Can Transformers overcome the lack of data in the simulation of history-dependent flows?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16305v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that the lack of information about certain variables necessary for the description of a dynamical system leads to the introduction of historical dependence (lack of Markovian character of the model) and noise. Traditionally, scientists have made up for these shortcomings by designing phenomenological variables that take into account this historical dependence (typically, conformational tensors in fluids). Often, these phenomenological variables are not easily measurable experimentally. In this work, we study to what extent Transformer architectures are able to cope with the lack of experimental data on these variables. The methodology is evaluated on three benchmark problems: a cylinder flow with no history dependence, a viscoelastic Couette flow modeled via the Oldroyd-B formalism, and a non-linear polymeric fluid described by the FENE model. Our results show that the Transformer outperforms a thermodynamically consistent, structure-preserving neural network with metriplectic bias in systems with missing experimental data, providing lower errors even in low-dimensional latent spaces. In contrast, for systems whose state variables can be fully known, the metriplectic model achieves superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing the Network Topology of a Linear Reservoir Computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23391v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has become a fundamental approach for modeling, prediction, and control, enabling systems to learn from data and perform complex tasks. Reservoir computing is a machine learning tool that leverages high-dimensional dynamical systems to efficiently process temporal data for prediction and observation tasks. Traditionally, the connectivity of the network that underlies a reservoir computer (RC) is generated randomly, lacking a principled design. Here, we focus on optimizing the connectivity of a linear RC to improve its performance and interpretability, which we achieve by decoupling the RC dynamics into a number of independent modes. We then proceed to optimize each one of these modes to perform a given task, which corresponds to selecting an optimal RC connectivity in terms of a given set of eigenvalues of the RC adjacency matrix. Simulations on networks of varying sizes show that the optimized RC significantly outperforms randomly constructed reservoirs in both training and testing phases and often surpasses nonlinear reservoirs of comparable size. This approach provides both practical performance advantages and theoretical guidelines for designing efficient, task-specific, and analytically transparent RC architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information theory and discriminative sampling for model discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16000v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fisher information and Shannon entropy are fundamental tools for understanding and analyzing dynamical systems from complementary perspectives. They can characterize unknown parameters by quantifying the information contained in variables, or measure how different initial trajectories or temporal segments of a trajectory contribute to learning or inferring system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) within the data-driven framework of {\em sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics} (SINDy). We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning and Control: Foundations, Advances, and Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03303v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control theory of dynamical systems offers a powerful framework for tackling challenges in deep neural networks and other machine learning architectures. We show that concepts such as simultaneous and ensemble controllability offer new insights into the classification and representation properties of deep neural networks, while the control and optimization of static systems can be employed to better understand the performance of shallow networks. Inspired by the classical concept of turnpike, we also explore the relationship between dynamic and static neural networks, where depth is traded for width, and the role of transformers as mechanisms for accelerating classical neural network tasks. We also exploit the expressive power of neural networks (exemplified, for instance, by the Universal Approximation Theorem) to develop a novel hybrid modeling methodology, the Hybrid-Cooperative Learning (HYCO), combining mechanics and data-driven methods in a game-theoretic setting. Finally, we describe how classical properties of diffusion processes, long established in the context of partial differential equations, contribute to explaining the success of modern generative artificial intelligence (AI). We present an overview of our recent results in these areas, illustrating how control, machine learning, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations come together to motivate a fertile ground for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03631v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical-circuit data, in which the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method can recover the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as STLSQ, fail to do so with the available data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.</p></details> | 46 pages, 9 figures |

In essence, it quantifies the similarity across densities of the clusters, which are defined by a given labeling. This labeling may originate from a geometric partitioning of the state space itself, but need not in general. We illustrate its performance on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the Iris benchmark data set, and a high-imbalance resource-allocation scenario, showing that the BSI provides a coherent assessment in cases where traditional metrics give incomplete or misleading signals. Moreover, in the resource-allocation setting where equal density may be associated with a "fair" distribution, we demonstrate that BSI not only detects inequality with high sensitivity, but also offers a numerically smooth measure that can be easily embedded in optimization frameworks as a regularization term for modern policy-making. Finally, the BSI also offers a new measure of the effectiveness for a given symbolic representation, i.e. coarse-grain states, for continuous-valued data recorded from complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-parametric Causal Inference in Dynamic Thresholding Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15244v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider a setting where we regularly monitor patients' fasting blood sugar, and declare them to have prediabetes (and encourage preventative care) if this number crosses a pre-specified threshold. The sharp, threshold-based treatment policy suggests that we should be able to estimate the long-term benefit of this preventative care by comparing the health trajectories of patients with blood sugar measurements right above and below the threshold. A naive regression-discontinuity analysis, however, is not applicable here, as it ignores the temporal dynamics of the problem where, e.g., a patient just below the threshold on one visit may become prediabetic (and receive treatment) following their next visit. Here, we study thresholding designs in general dynamic systems, and show that simple reduced-form characterizations remain available for a relevant causal target, namely a dynamic marginal policy effect at the treatment threshold. We develop a local-linear-regression approach for estimation and inference of this estimand, and demonstrate promise of our approach in numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Many Heads Make an SSM? A Unified Framework for Attention and State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15115v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence modeling has produced diverse architectures -- from classical recurrent neural networks to modern Transformers and state space models (SSMs) -- yet a unified theoretical understanding of expressivity and trainability trade-offs remains limited. We introduce a unified framework that represents a broad class of sequence maps via an input-dependent effective interaction operator $W_{ij}(X)$, making explicit two recurring construction patterns: (i) the Unified Factorized Framework (Explicit) (attention-style mixing), in which $W_{ij}(X)$ varies through scalar coefficients applied to shared value maps, and (ii) Structured Dynamics (Implicit) (state-space recurrences), in which $W_{ij}$ is induced by a latent dynamical system. Using this framework, we derive three theoretical results. First, we establish the Interaction Rank Gap: models in the Unified Factorized Framework, such as single-head attention, are constrained to a low-dimensional operator span and cannot represent certain structured dynamical maps. Second, we prove an Equivalence (Head-Count) Theorem showing that, within our multi-head factorized class, representing a linear SSM whose lag operators span a $k$-dimensional subspace on length-$n$ sequences requires and is achievable with $H=k$ heads. Third, we prove a Gradient Highway Result, showing that attention layers admit inputs with distance-independent gradient paths, whereas stable linear dynamics exhibit distance-dependent gradient attenuation. Together, these results formalize a fundamental trade-off between algebraic expressivity (interaction/operator span) and long-range gradient propagation, providing theoretical grounding for modern sequence architecture design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dense Associative Memories with Analog Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15002v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational demands of modern AI systems have exposed fundamental limitations of digital hardware, driving interest in alternative paradigms for efficient large-scale inference. Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) is a family of models that offers a flexible framework for representing many contemporary neural architectures, such as transformers and diffusion models, by casting them as dynamical systems evolving on an energy landscape. In this work, we propose a general method for building analog accelerators for DenseAMs and implementing them using electronic RC circuits, crossbar arrays, and amplifiers. We find that our analog DenseAM hardware performs inference in constant time independent of model size. This result highlights an asymptotic advantage of analog DenseAMs over digital numerical solvers that scale at least linearly with the model size. We consider three settings of progressively increasing complexity: XOR, the Hamming (7,4) code, and a simple language model defined on binary variables. We propose analog implementations of these three models and analyze the scaling of inference time, energy consumption, and hardware. Finally, we estimate lower bounds on the achievable time constants imposed by amplifier specifications, suggesting that even conservative existing analog technology can enable inference times on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds. By harnessing the intrinsic parallelism and continuous-time operation of analog circuits, our DenseAM-based accelerator design offers a new avenue for fast and scalable AI hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Physical Basis for Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09567v6)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What is information, physically, and why does it so reliably emerge in living, cultural, and technological systems? Existing theories quantify uncertainty, cost, or compressibility, but do not identify which physical structures count as information or how informational entities arise from dynamics. Here we introduce a causal-physical framework that defines information as a heritable causal role played by persistent (metastable) structures in a dynamical system. We represent long-lived structures as almost-invariant sets and assemble them into causal structure sets that encode how such structures generate, transform, and maintain one another. Within this representation, informational entities are singled out by three generative motifs: replication, heritable variation, and translation under shared templates, which together define when a collection of structures constitutes an information family. We demonstrate the full pipeline by mapping a concrete cultural episode (fruit-salad recipe sharing and modification) into a causal structure set, and show how the motifs and information families can then be identified algorithmically. The framework yields computable quantities, including informational fitness and informational entropy, directly from causal structure, enabling informational variants to be detected, compared, and tracked across biological, cultural, engineered, and digital domains. Finally, motivated by analogies to random directed graphs and catalytic networks, we propose testable conditions under which hereditary informational motifs become statistically generic in sufficiently large causal-physical systems.</p></details> | - |
| **[From STLS to Projection-based Dictionary Selection in Sparse Regression for System Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14404v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we revisit dictionary-based sparse regression, in particular, Sequential Threshold Least Squares (STLS), and propose a score-guided library selection to provide practical guidance for data-driven modeling, with emphasis on SINDy-type algorithms. STLS is an algorithm to solve the $\ell_0$ sparse least-squares problem, which relies on splitting to efficiently solve the least-squares portion while handling the sparse term via proximal methods. It produces coefficient vectors whose components depend on both the projected reconstruction errors, here referred to as the scores, and the mutual coherence of dictionary terms. The first contribution of this work is a theoretical analysis of the score and dictionary-selection strategy. This could be understood in both the original and weak SINDy regime. Second, numerical experiments on ordinary and partial differential equations highlight the effectiveness of score-based screening, improving both accuracy and interpretability in dynamical system identification. These results suggest that integrating score-guided methods to refine the dictionary more accurately may help SINDy users in some cases to enhance their robustness for data-driven discovery of governing equations.</p></details> | 34 pages, 11 figures |

Existing approaches to learning such dynamics typically either discretize time -- leading to poor performance on irregularly sampled data -- or ignore the underlying causality. We propose CaDyT, a novel method for causal discovery on dynamical systems addressing both these challenges. In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process. We propose a practical instantiation that identifies the causal structure via a greedy search guided by the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. Our experiments show that CaDyT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data, discovering causal networks closer to the true underlying dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Oral at AAAI 2026 Conference</p></details> |
| **[CiRL: Open-Source Environments for Reinforcement Learning in Circular Economy and Net Zero](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21536v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand of finite raw materials will keep increasing as they fuel modern society. Simultaneously, solutions for stopping carbon emissions in the short term are not available, thus making the net zero target extremely challenging to achieve at scale. The circular economy (CE) paradigm is gaining attention as a solution to address climate change and the uncertainties of supplies of critical materials. Hence, in this paper, we introduce CiRL, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) library of environments focused on the circularity control of both solid and fluid materials. The integration of DRL into the design of material circularity is possible thanks to the formalism of thermodynamical material networks, which is underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics. Along with the focus on circularity, this library has three more features: the new CE-oriented environments are in the state-space form, which is typically used in dynamical systems analysis and control design; it is based on a state-of-the-art Python library of DRL algorithms, namely, Stable-Baselines3; and it is developed in Google Colaboratory to be accessible to researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds as is often the case for circular economy researchers and engineers. CiRL is intended to be a tool to generate AI-driven actions for optimizing the circularity of supply-recovery chains and to be combined with human-driven decisions derived from material flow analysis (MFA) studies. CiRL is publicly available.</p></details> | To be submitted |
| **[Fully Bayesian Differential Gaussian Processes through Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06069v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Gaussian process models typically employ discrete hierarchies, but recent advancements in differential Gaussian processes (DiffGPs) have extended these models to infinite depths. However, existing DiffGP approaches often overlook the uncertainty in kernel hyperparameters by treating them as fixed and time-invariant, which degrades the model's predictive performance and neglects the posterior distribution. In this work, we introduce a fully Bayesian framework that models kernel hyperparameters as random variables and utilizes coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to jointly learn their posterior distributions alongside those of inducing points. By incorporating the estimation uncertainty of hyperparameters, our method significantly enhances model flexibility and adaptability to complex dynamic systems. Furthermore, we employ a black-box adaptive SDE solver with a neural network to achieve realistic, time varying posterior approximations, thereby improving the expressiveness of the variational posterior. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and other key performance metrics. This work not only provides a robust Bayesian extension to DiffGP models but also validates its effectiveness in handling intricate dynamic behaviors, thereby advancing the applicability of Gaussian process models in diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised learning of multiscale switching dynamical system models from multimodal neural data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12881v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural population activity often exhibits regime-dependent non-stationarity in the form of switching dynamics. Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |
| **[From Linear Risk to Emergent Harm: Complexity as the Missing Core of AI Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12707v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Risk-based AI regulation has become the dominant paradigm in AI governance, promising proportional controls aligned with anticipated harms. This paper argues that such frameworks often fail for structural reasons: they implicitly assume linear causality, stable system boundaries, and largely predictable responses to regulation. In practice, AI operates within complex adaptive socio-technical systems in which harm is frequently emergent, delayed, redistributed, and amplified through feedback loops and strategic adaptation by system actors. As a result, compliance can increase while harm is displaced or concealed rather than eliminated. We propose a complexity-based framework for AI governance that treats regulation as intervention rather than control, prioritises dynamic system mapping over static classifications, and integrates causal reasoning and simulation for policy design under uncertainty. The aim is not to eliminate uncertainty, but to enable robust system stewardship through monitoring, learning, and iterative revision of governance interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>White...</summary><p>White Paper / Policy Brief (Working Paper).

Traditional retrieval methods are constrained by database coverage and quality. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enable direct location reasoning from image content, yet individual models struggle with diverse geographic regions and complex scenes. Existing multi-agent systems improve performance through model collaboration but treat all agent interactions uniformly. They lack mechanisms to handle conflicting predictions effectively. We propose \textbf{GraphGeo}, a multi-agent debate framework using heterogeneous graph neural networks for visual geo-localization. Our approach models diverse debate relationships through typed edges, distinguishing supportive collaboration, competitive argumentation, and knowledge transfer. We introduce a dual-level debate mechanism combining node-level refinement and edge-level argumentation modeling. A cross-level topology refinement strategy enables co-evolution between graph structure and agent representations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate GraphGeo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our framework transforms cognitive conflicts between agents into enhanced geo-localization accuracy through structured debate.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission has been withdrawn by the authors due to a fundamental error in the methodology that affects the validity of the main results</p></details> |
| **[Learning Continuous Solvent Effects from Transient Flow Data: A Graph Neural Network Benchmark on Catechol Rearrangement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19530v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting reaction outcomes across continuous solvent composition ranges remains a critical challenge in organic synthesis and process chemistry. Traditional machine learning approaches often treat solvent identity as a discrete categorical variable, which prevents systematic interpolation and extrapolation across the solvent space. This work introduces the \textbf{Catechol Benchmark}, a high-throughput transient flow chemistry dataset comprising 1,227 experimental yield measurements for the rearrangement of allyl-substituted catechol in 24 pure solvents and their binary mixtures, parameterized by continuous volume fractions ($\% B$). We evaluate various architectures under rigorous leave-one-solvent-out and leave-one-mixture-out protocols to test generalization to unseen chemical environments. Our results demonstrate that classical tabular methods (e.g., Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees) and large language model embeddings (e.g., Qwen-7B) struggle with quantitative precision, yielding Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of 0.099 and 0.129, respectively. In contrast, we propose a hybrid GNN-based architecture that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP) and learned mixture-aware solvent encodings. This approach achieves an \textbf{MSE of 0.0039} ($\pm$ 0.0003), representing a 60\% error reduction over competitive baselines and a $>25\times$ improvement over tabular ensembles. Ablation studies confirm that explicit molecular graph message-passing and continuous mixture encoding are essential for robust generalization. The complete dataset, evaluation protocols, and reference implementations are released to facilitate data-efficient reaction prediction and continuous solvent representation learning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

These models were widely tested on the graph datasets consisting of organic molecules; however, those studies disregarded the inorganic nanomaterials datasets. In this work, we close this gap by applying Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks (KAGNNs) to a recently published large inorganic nanomaterials dataset called CHILI. For this, we adapt and test KAGNNs appropriate for this dataset. Our experiments reveal that on the CHILI datasets, particularly on the CHILI-3K, KAGNNs substantially surpass conventional GNNs in classification, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning General Policies with Policy Gradient Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19366v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning methods have delivered remarkable results in a number of settings, generalization, i.e., the ability to produce policies that generalize in a reliable and systematic way, has remained a challenge. The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2023)</p></details> |

We begin with A-MPLang, the fragment without activation functions, and give a characterization of its expressive power in terms of walk-summed features. For bounded activation functions, we show that (under mild conditions) all eventually constant activations yield the same expressive power - numerical and Boolean - and that it subsumes previously established logics for GNNs with eventually constant activation functions but without linear layers. Finally, we prove the first expressive separation between unbounded and bounded activations in the presence of linear layers: MPLang with ReLU is strictly more powerful for numerical queries than MPLang with eventually constant activation functions, e.g., truncated ReLU. This hinges on subtle interactions between linear aggregation and eventually constant non-linearities, and it establishes that GNNs using ReLU are more expressive than those restricted to eventually constant activations and linear layers.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, due to the vulnerabilities of GNNs, it has been empirically shown that malicious attackers could easily corrupt the fairness level of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. In this paper, we take crucial steps to study a novel problem of certifiable defense on the fairness level of GNNs. Specifically, we propose a principled framework named ELEGANT and present a detailed theoretical certification analysis for the fairness of GNNs. ELEGANT takes {\em any} GNN as its backbone, and the fairness level of such a backbone is theoretically impossible to be corrupted under certain perturbation budgets for attackers. Notably, ELEGANT does not make any assumptions over the GNN structure or parameters, and does not require re-training the GNNs to realize certification. Hence it can serve as a plug-and-play framework for any optimized GNNs ready to be deployed. We verify the satisfactory effectiveness of ELEGANT in practice through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different backbones of GNNs and parameter settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGKDD'26 for publication</p></details> |

This gap yields explanations that may appear faithful yet be unreliable in practice. To this end, we propose LogicXGNN, a post-hoc framework that constructs logical rules over reliable predicates explicitly designed to capture the GNN's message-passing structure, thereby ensuring effective grounding. We further introduce data-grounded fidelity ($\textit{Fid}_{\mathcal{D}}$), a realistic metric that evaluates explanations in their final-graph form, along with complementary utility metrics such as coverage and validity. Across extensive experiments, LogicXGNN improves $\textit{Fid}_{\mathcal{D}}$ by over 20% on average relative to state-of-the-art methods while being 10-100 $\times$ faster. With strong scalability and utility performance, LogicXGNN produces explanations that are faithful to the model's logic and reliably grounded in observable data.

At the same time, filtering through the massive volume of available research has become more challenging than ever. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and graph attention mechanisms have shown strong effectiveness in searching large-scale information databases, particularly when combined with modern large language models.

Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We introduce a policy parameterization that embeds Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into a Youla-like magnitude-direction parameterization, yielding distributed stochastic controllers that guarantee network-level closed-loop stability by design. The magnitude is implemented as a stable operator consisting of a GNN acting on disturbance feedback, while the direction is a GNN acting on local observations. We prove robustness of the closed loop to perturbations in both the graph topology and model parameters, and show how to integrate our parameterization with Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments on a multi-agent navigation task show that policies trained on small networks transfer directly to larger ones and unseen network topologies, achieve higher returns and lower variance than a state-of-the-art MARL baseline while preserving stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Classification of Synthetic Graph Generative Models: A Benchmarking Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18524v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to discriminate between generative graph models is critical to understanding complex structural patterns in both synthetic graphs and the real-world structures that they emulate. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have seen increasing use to great effect in graph classification tasks, few studies explore their integration with interpretable graph theoretic features. This paper investigates the classification of synthetic graph families using a hybrid approach that combines GNNs with engineered graph-theoretic features. We generate a large and structurally diverse synthetic dataset comprising graphs from five representative generative families, Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barab'asi-Albert, Holme-Kim, and Stochastic Block Model. These graphs range in size up to 1x10^4 nodes, containing up to 1.1x10^5 edges. A comprehensive range of node and graph level features is extracted for each graph and pruned using a Random Forest based feature selection pipeline. The features are integrated into six GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, GATv2, GIN, GraphSAGE and GTN. Each architecture is optimised for hyperparameter selection using Optuna. Finally, models were compared against a baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained solely on the handcrafted features. Our evaluation demonstrates that GraphSAGE and GTN achieve the highest classification performance, with 98.5% accuracy, and strong class separation evidenced by t-SNE and UMAP visualisations. GCN and GIN also performed well, while GAT-based models lagged due to limitations in their ability to capture global structures. The SVM baseline confirmed the importance of the message passing functionality for performance gains and meaningful class separation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version of a manuscript currently under review at The Journal of Supercomputing (Springer)</p></details> |

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Our model integrates context-aware edge attention, confidence-guided blending of node features and graph representations, and neighborhood consistency regularization to better capture clinically meaningful relationships between patients. To handle unseen patients, we introduce a mini-graph approach that leverages the nearest neighbors of the new patient, enabling real-time explainable predictions without retraining the global model. We evaluate APC-GNN++ on a real-world diabetes dataset collected from a regional hospital in Algeria and show that it outperforms traditional machine learning models (MLP, Random Forest, XGBoost) and a vanilla GCN, achieving higher test accuracy and macro F1- score. The analysis of node-level confidence scores further reveals how the model balances self-information and graph-based evidence across different patient groups, providing interpretable patient-centric insights. The system is also embedded in a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive use by healthcare professionals .</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for City-Scale Dynamic Logistics Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18441v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>City-scale logistics routing has become increasingly challenging as metropolitan road networks grow to tens of millions of edges and traffic conditions evolve rapidly under high-volume mobility demands. Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for next-generation intelligent transportation systems and large-scale logistics platforms.</p></details> |  |

We introduce PRISm (Pruning-based Image Retrieval via Importance Prediction on Semantic Graphs), a multimodal framework that advances image-to-image retrieval through two novel components. First, the Importance Prediction Module identifies and retains the most critical objects and relational triplets within an image while pruning irrelevant elements. Second, the Edge-Aware Graph Neural Network explicitly encodes relational structure and integrates global visual features to produce semantically informed image embeddings. PRISm achieves image retrieval that closely aligns with human perception by explicitly modeling the semantic importance of objects and their interactions, capabilities largely absent in prior approaches. Its architecture effectively combines relational reasoning with visual representation, enabling semantically grounded retrieval. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate consistently superior top-ranked performance, while qualitative analyses show that PRISm accurately captures key objects and interactions, producing interpretable and semantically meaningful results.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Recent proposals on Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks~(STGNNs) have made significant progress by combining sequential models with graph convolution networks. However, due to high complexity issues, STGNNs only focus on short-term traffic forecasting (e.g., 1-h ahead), while ignoring more practical long-term forecasting. In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore long-term traffic forecasting (e.g., 1-day ahead). To this end, we first reveal its unique challenges in exploiting multi-scale representations. Then, we propose a novel Hierarchical U-Net TransFormer~(HUTFormer) to address the issues of long-term traffic forecasting. HUTFormer consists of a hierarchical encoder and decoder to jointly generate and utilize multi-scale representations of traffic data. Specifically, for the encoder, we {\color{black}propose} window self-attention and segment merging to extract multi-scale representations from long-term traffic data. For the decoder, we design a cross-scale attention mechanism to effectively incorporate multi-scale representations. In addition, HUTFormer employs an efficient input embedding strategy to address the complexity issues. Extensive experiments on four traffic datasets show that the proposed HUTFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art traffic forecasting and long time series forecasting baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Communications in Transportation Research on December 2025. 38 paqes with 9 fiqures and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[SEA: Spectral Edge Attack on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08964v3)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in a variety of domains. However, the very ability of graphs to represent complex data structures is both the key strength of GNNs and a major source of their vulnerability. Recent studies have shown that attacking GNNs by maliciously perturbing the underlying graph can severely degrade their performance. For attack methods, the central challenge is to maintain attack effectiveness while remaining difficult to detect. Most existing attacks require modifying the graph structure, such as adding or deleting edges, which is relatively easy to notice. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new attack model that employs spectral adversarial robustness evaluation to quantitatively analyze the vulnerability of each edge in a graph. By precisely targeting the weakest links, our method can achieve effective attacks without changing the connectivity pattern of edges in the graph, for example by subtly adjusting the weights of a small subset of the most vulnerable edges. We apply the proposed method to attack several classical graph neural network architectures, and experimental results show that our attack is highly effective.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods particularly those based on experience replay typically store and revisit past graph data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these approaches pose significant limitations, including privacy concerns, inefficiency. In this work, we propose AL GNN, a novel framework for continual graph learning that eliminates the need for backpropagation and replay buffers. Instead, AL GNN leverages principles from analytic learning theory to formulate learning as a recursive least squares optimization process. It maintains and updates model knowledge analytically through closed form classifier updates and a regularized feature autocorrelation matrix. This design enables efficient one pass training for each task, and inherently preserves data privacy by avoiding historical sample storage. Extensive experiments on multiple dynamic graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that AL GNN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods. For instance, it improves average performance by 10% on CoraFull and reduces forgetting by over 30% on Reddit, while also reducing training time by nearly 50% due to its backpropagation free design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v3)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoSchA: Automatic Hierarchical Music Representations via Multi-Relational Node Isolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18232v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical representations provide powerful and principled approaches for analyzing many musical genres. Such representations have been broadly studied in music theory, for instance via Schenkerian analysis (SchA). Hierarchical music analyses, however, are highly cost-intensive; the analysis of a single piece of music requires a great deal of time and effort from trained experts. The representation of hierarchical analyses in a computer-readable format is a further challenge. Given recent developments in hierarchical deep learning and increasing quantities of computer-readable data, there is great promise in extending such work for an automatic hierarchical representation framework. This paper thus introduces a novel approach, AutoSchA, which extends recent developments in graph neural networks (GNNs) for hierarchical music analysis. AutoSchA features three key contributions: 1) a new graph learning framework for hierarchical music representation, 2) a new graph pooling mechanism based on node isolation that directly optimizes learned pooling assignments, and 3) a state-of-the-art architecture that integrates such developments for automatic hierarchical music analysis. We show, in a suite of experiments, that AutoSchA performs comparably to human experts when analyzing Baroque fugue subjects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Efficient Testing of Graph Neural Networks via Test Input Prioritization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18228v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in handling graph-structured data; however, they exhibit failures after deployment, which can cause severe consequences. Hence, conducting thorough testing before deployment becomes imperative to ensure the reliability of GNNs. However, thorough testing requires numerous manually annotated test data. To mitigate the annotation cost, strategically prioritizing and labeling high-quality unlabeled inputs for testing becomes crucial, which facilitates uncovering more model failures with a limited labeling budget. Unfortunately, existing test input prioritization techniques either overlook the valuable information contained in graph structures or are overly reliant on attributes extracted from the target model, i.e., model-aware attributes, whose quality can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose a novel test input prioritization framework, named GraphRank, for GNNs. GraphRank introduces model-agnostic attributes to compensate for the limitations of the model-aware ones. It also leverages the graph structure information to aggregate attributes from neighboring nodes, thereby enhancing the model-aware and model-agnostic attributes. Furthermore, GraphRank combines the above attributes with a binary classifier, using it as a ranking model to prioritize inputs. This classifier undergoes iterative training, which enables it to learn from each round's feedback and improve its performance accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate GraphRank's superiority over existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author-accepted manuscript of a paper published in Automated Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Distribution Learning for Graph Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15206v4)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</p></details> | 8 pages |

This paper presents a comprehensive XAI framework designed to bridge the trust gap in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) by making graph-based detection transparent. We implement this framework on top of KAIROS, a state-of-the-art temporal graph-based IDS, though our design is applicable to any temporal graph-based detector with minimal adaptation. The complete codebase is available at https://github.com/devang1304/provex.git. We augment the detection pipeline with post-hoc explanations that highlight why an alert was triggered, identifying key causal subgraphs and events. We adapt three GNN explanation methods - GraphMask, GNNExplainer, and a variational temporal GNN explainer (VA-TGExplainer) - to the temporal provenance context. These tools output human-interpretable representations of anomalous behavior, including important edges and uncertainty estimates. Our contributions focus on the practical integration of these explainers, addressing challenges in memory management and reproducibility. We demonstrate our framework on the DARPA CADETS Engagement 3 dataset and show that it produces concise window-level explanations for detected attacks. Our evaluation reveals that the explainers preserve the TGNN's decisions with high fidelity, surfacing critical edges such as malicious file interactions and anomalous netflows. The average explanation overhead is 3-5 seconds per event. By providing insight into the model's reasoning, our framework aims to improve analyst trust and triage speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairExpand: Individual Fairness on Graphs with Partial Similarity Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18180v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual fairness, which requires that similar individuals should be treated similarly by algorithmic systems, has become a central principle in fair machine learning. Individual fairness has garnered traction in graph representation learning due to its practical importance in high-stakes Web areas such as user modeling, recommender systems, and search. However, existing methods assume the existence of predefined similarity information over all node pairs, an often unrealistic requirement that prevents their operationalization in practice. In this paper, we assume the similarity information is only available for a limited subset of node pairs and introduce FairExpand, a flexible framework that promotes individual fairness in this more realistic partial information scenario. FairExpand follows a two-step pipeline that alternates between refining node representations using a backbone model (e.g., a graph neural network) and gradually propagating similarity information, which allows fairness enforcement to effectively expand to the entire graph. Extensive experiments show that FairExpand consistently enhances individual fairness while preserving performance, making it a practical solution for enabling graph-based individual fairness in real-world applications with partial similarity information.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces the interactive Swarm Leader Identification (iSLI) problem, a novel approach where an adversarial probing agent identifies a swarm's leader by physically interacting with its members. We formulate the iSLI problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employ Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train the prober's policy. The proposed approach utilizes a novel neural network architecture featuring a Timed Graph Relationformer (TGR) layer combined with a Simplified Structured State Space Sequence (S5) model. The TGR layer effectively processes graph-based observations of the swarm, capturing temporal dependencies and fusing relational information using a learned gating mechanism to generate informative representations for policy learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our TGR-based model outperforms baseline graph neural network architectures and exhibits significant zero-shot generalization capabilities across varying swarm sizes and speeds different from those used during training. The trained prober achieves high accuracy in identifying the leader, maintaining performance even in out-of-training distribution scenarios, and showing appropriate confidence levels in its predictions. Real-world experiments with physical robots further validate the approach, confirming successful sim-to-real transfer and robustness to dynamic changes, such as unexpected agent disconnections.</p></details> | 13 pages, journal |

A Benchmark for Long-Range Graph Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17762v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively capturing long-range interactions remains a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in graph neural network (GNN) research, critical for applications across diverse fields of science. To systematically address this, we introduce ECHO (Evaluating Communication over long HOps), a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess the capabilities of GNNs in handling very long-range graph propagation. ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Both tasks inherently depend on capturing complex long-range molecular interactions. Our extensive benchmarking of popular GNN architectures reveals clear performance gaps, emphasizing the difficulty of true long-range propagation and highlighting design choices capable of overcoming inherent limitations. ECHO thereby sets a new standard for evaluating long-range information propagation, also providing a compelling example for its need in AI for science.</p></details> |  |

Hence, they are critical components of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. While many existing systems depend on multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam videos presents a more challenging, yet more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate improved spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to enhance state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets (DAD, DoTA and DADA) show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-accident scores than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |

While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.</p></details> |  |

In the non-uniform setting, such GNNs have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a vertex satisfies a specified property. In the uniform setting, the expressive power relative to MSO is exactly that of modal logic, and thus identical to the (absolute) expressive power of GNNs with max aggregation. The proof, however, depends on constructions that are not satisfactory from a practical perspective. This leads us to making the natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and classification functions are thresholds. The resulting class of GNNs with mean aggregation turns out to be much less expressive: relative to MSO and in the uniform setting, it has the same expressive power as alternation-free modal logic. This is in contrast to the expressive power of GNNs with max and sum aggregation, which is not affected by these assumptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, extended version of paper to appear in AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Lite-STGNN thus offers a compact, interpretable, and efficient framework for long-term multivariate time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, journal</p></details> |

Yet the computational form of these biases and their neural implementation remain poorly understood. We introduce a framework that combines Graph Theory and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to formalize inductive biases as explicit, manipulable priors over structure and abstraction. Using a human behavioral dataset adapted from the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), we show that differences in graph-based priors can explain individual differences in human solutions. Our method includes an optimization pipeline that searches over graph configurations, varying edge connectivity and node abstraction, and a visualization approach that identifies the computational graph, the subset of nodes and edges most critical to a model's prediction. Systematic ablation reveals how generalization depends on specific prior structures and internal processing, exposing why human like errors emerge from incorrect or incomplete priors. This work provides a principled, interpretable framework for modeling the representational assumptions and computational dynamics underlying generalization, offering new insights into human reasoning and a foundation for more human aligned AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 7 figures, 3 suppl figures</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Force Metrics: Pre-Training MLFFs for Stable MD Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14850v3)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. By analyzing local properties of the learned force fields, we find that pre-training produces more structured latent representations, smoother force responses to local geometric changes, and more consistent force differences between nearby configurations, all of which contribute to more stable and reliable MD simulations. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffeoMorph: Learning to Morph 3D Shapes Using Differentiable Agent-Based Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17129v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological systems can form complex three-dimensional structures through the collective behavior of identical agents -- cells that follow the same internal rules and communicate without central control. How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dirichlet Meets Horvitz and Thompson: Estimating Homophily in Large Networks via Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17084v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing homophily in large-scale networks is central to understanding structural regularities in graphs, and thus inform the choice of models (such as graph neural networks) adopted to learn from network data. Evaluation of smoothness metrics requires access to the entire network topology and node features, which may be impractical in several large-scale, dynamic, resource-limited, or privacy-constrained settings. In this work, we propose a sampling-based framework to estimate homophily via the Dirichlet energy (Laplacian-based total variation) of graph signals, leveraging the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator for unbiased inference from partial graph observations. The Dirichlet energy is a so-termed total (of squared nodal feature deviations) over graph edges; hence, estimable under general network sampling designs for which edge-inclusion probabilities can be analytically derived and used as weights in the proposed HT estimator. We establish that the Dirichlet energy can be consistently estimated from sampled graphs, and empirically study other heterophily measures as well. Experiments on several heterophilic benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HT estimators in reliably capturing homophilic structure (or lack thereof) from sampled network measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Riemannian Stochastic Interpolants for Amorphous Particle Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16607v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern generative models hold great promise for accelerating diverse tasks involving the simulation of physical systems, but they must be adapted to the specific constraints of each domain. Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GFLAN: Generative Functional Layouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16275v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Sharpness-aware Federated Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16247v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of many impediments to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to large-scale real-world graph data is the challenge of centralized training, which requires aggregating data from different organizations, raising privacy concerns. Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \textbf{S}harpness-aware f\textbf{E}derated gr\textbf{A}ph \textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants.</p></details> | Accepted by WSDM'26 |

This paper is a thorough guide to examine the changing reranker landscape and offer a clear view of the advancements made in reranking methods. We present a comprehensive survey of reranking models employed in IR, particularly within modern Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where retrieved documents notably influence output quality. We embark on a chronological journey through the historical trajectory of reranking techniques, starting with foundational approaches, before exploring the wide range of sophisticated neural network architectures such as cross-encoders, sequence-generation models like T5, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilized for structural information. Recognizing the computational cost of advancing neural rerankers, we analyze techniques for enhancing efficiency, notably knowledge distillation for creating competitive, lighter alternatives. Furthermore, we map the emerging territory of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking, examining novel prompting strategies and fine-tuning tactics. This survey seeks to elucidate the fundamental ideas, relative effectiveness, computational features, and real-world trade-offs of various reranking strategies. The survey provides a structured synthesis of the diverse reranking paradigms, highlighting their underlying principles and comparative strengths and weaknesses.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 1 figure, Accepted in CLNLP'25</p></details> |

Existing methods typically process spatial and feature views separately, fusing only at output level - an "encode-separately, fuse-late" paradigm that limits multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction. Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A Multimodal Approach to Alzheimer's Diagnosis: Geometric Insights from Cube Copying and Cognitive Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16184v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical clinical challenge, and cube-copying tasks offer a simple yet informative assessment of visuospatial function. This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD. Together, these results establish graph-based analysis of cube copying as an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening.</p></details> |  |
| **[SegGraph: Leveraging Graphs of SAM Segments for Few-Shot 3D Part Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16143v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel framework for few-shot 3D part segmentation. Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding. The code is available at: https://github.com/YueyangHu2000/SegGraph.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a new application for GNNs in the physical sciences: instrumentation design. As a case study, we apply GNNs to simulate models of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and show that they are capable of accurately capturing the complex optical physics at play, while achieving runtimes 815 times faster than state of the art simulation packages. We discuss the unique challenges this problem provides for machine learning models. In addition, we provide a dataset of high-fidelity optical physics simulations for three interferometer topologies, which can be used as a benchmarking suite for future work in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Multimodal Embeddings for Traffic Accident Prediction and Causal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02920v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages.

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Aligned Protein Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16896v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein language models (pLMs) pre-trained on vast protein sequence databases excel at various downstream tasks but often lack the structural knowledge essential for some biological applications. To address this, we introduce a method to enrich pLMs with structural knowledge by leveraging pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs). First, a latent-level contrastive learning task aligns residue representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins, injecting inter-protein structural information. Additionally, a physical-level task integrates intra-protein information by training pLMs to predict structure tokens. Together, the proposed dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter- and intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss selection module that uses a small model trained on high-quality structures to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn. Applying our structure alignment method as a simple, lightweight post-training step to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and AMPLIFY yields notable performance gains. These improvements are consistent across a wide range of tasks, including substantial gains in deep mutational scanning (DMS) fitness prediction and a 59% increase in P@L for ESM2 650M contact prediction on CASP16. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these performance gains are robust, scaling with model sizes from 8M to 650M and extending to different downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Exact Verification of Graph Neural Networks with Incremental Constraint Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09320v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile exact verifier for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) and biochemical datasets (MUTAG and ENZYMES) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance for node classification and competitiveness on graph classification compared to existing exact verification tools on sum-aggregated GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contextual Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Directed Controller Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15295v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controller synthesis is a formal method approach for automatically generating Labeled Transition System (LTS) controllers that satisfy specified properties. The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Subgraph Matching by Combining Algorithms and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20226v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph. Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph, making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

Nevertheless, the limited distribution of training data for the extensively utilised machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), predominantly sourced from near-equilibrium structures, results in unreliable adsorption structures and consequent adsorption energy predictions. In this context, we present DBCata, a deep generative model that integrates a periodic Brownian-bridge framework with an equivariant graph neural network to establish a low-dimensional transition manifold between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures, without requiring explicit energy or force information. Upon training, DBCata effectively generates high-fidelity adsorption geometries, achieving an interatomic distance mean absolute error (DMAE) of 0.035 \textÅ on the Catalysis-Hub dataset, which is nearly three times superior to that of the current state-of-the-art machine learning potential models. Moreover, the corresponding DFT accuracy can be improved within 0.1 eV in 94\% of instances by identifying and refining anomalous predictions through a hybrid chemical-heuristic and self-supervised outlier detection approach. We demonstrate that the remarkable performance of DBCata facilitates accelerated high-throughput computational screening for efficient alloy catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction, highlighting the potential of DBCata as a powerful tool for catalyst design and optimisation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a Dual-Axis Representation-Complete Convergent Learning (RCCL) strategy, enabled by a molecular representation that integrates graph convolutional network (GCN) encoding of local valence environments, grounded in modern valence bond theory, together with no-bridge graph (NBG) encoding of ring/cage topologies, providing a quantitative measure of chemical-space coverage. This framework formalizes representation completeness, establishing a principled basis for constructing datasets that support convergent learning for large models. Guided by this RCCL framework, we develop the FD25 dataset, systematically covering 13,302 local valence units and 165,726 ring/cage topologies, achieving near-complete combinatorial coverage of organic molecules with H/C/N/O/F elements. Graph neural networks trained on FD25 exhibit representation-complete convergent learning and strong out-of-distribution generalization, with an overall prediction error of approximately 1.0 kcal/mol MAE across external benchmarks. Our results establish a quantitative link between molecular representation, structural completeness, and model generalization, providing a foundation for interpretable, transferable, and data-efficient molecular intelligence.</p></details> | 33 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Convergent Privacy Framework for Multi-layer GNNs through Contractive Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22727v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has been integrated into graph neural networks (GNNs) to protect sensitive structural information, e.g., edges, nodes, and associated features across various applications. A prominent approach is to perturb the message-passing process, which forms the core of most GNN architectures. However, existing methods typically incur a privacy cost that grows linearly with the number of layers (e.g., GAP published in Usenix Security'23), ultimately requiring excessive noise to maintain a reasonable privacy level. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when multi-layer GNNs, which have shown better performance than one-layer GNN, are used to process graph data with sensitive information. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the privacy budget converges with respect to the number of layers by applying privacy amplification techniques to the message-passing process, exploiting the contractive properties inherent to standard GNN operations. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a simple yet effective Contractive Graph Layer (CGL) that ensures the contractiveness required for theoretical guarantees while preserving model utility. Our framework, CARIBOU, supports both training and inference, equipped with a contractive aggregation module, a privacy allocation module, and a privacy auditing module. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CARIBOU significantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off and achieves superior performance in privacy auditing tasks.</p></details> | 31 pages |

The primary task of gate-level reverse engineering is to separate the control and data signals from the netlist, which is mainly realized by identifying state registers with topological comparison.However, these methods become inefficient for large scale netlist. In this work, we propose RELIC-GNN, a graph neural network based state registers identification method, to address these issues. RELIC-GNN models the path structure of register as a graph and generates corresponding representation by considering node attributes and graph structure during training. The trained GNN model could be adopted to find the registers type very efficiently. Experimental results show that RELIC-GNN could achieve 100% in recall, 30.49% in precision and 88.37% in accuracy on average across different designs, which obtains significant improvements than previous approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveGNN: Integrating Graph Neural Networks and Transformers for Decay-Aware Classification of Irregular Clinical Time-Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10621v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical time series are often irregularly sampled, with varying sensor frequencies, missing observations, and misaligned timestamps. Prior approaches typically address these irregularities by interpolating data into regular sequences, thereby introducing bias, or by generating inconsistent and uninterpretable relationships across sensor measurements, complicating the accurate learning of both intra-series and inter-series dependencies. We introduce WaveGNN, a model that operates directly on irregular multivariate time series without interpolation or conversion to a regular representation. WaveGNN combines a decay-aware Transformer to capture intra-series dynamics with a sample-specific graph neural network that models both short-term and long-term inter-sensor relationships. Therefore, it generates a single, sparse, and interpretable graph per sample. Across multiple benchmark datasets (P12, P19, MIMIC-III, and PAM), WaveGNN delivers consistently strong performance, whereas other state-of-the-art baselines tend to perform well on some datasets or tasks but poorly on others. While WaveGNN does not necessarily surpass every method in every case, its consistency and robustness across diverse settings set it apart. Moreover, the learned graphs align well with known physiological structures, enhancing interpretability and supporting clinical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE BigData 2025.

| **[Improving Graph Neural Network Training, Defense and Hypergraph Partitioning via Adversarial Robustness Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v9)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise and adversarial attacks from both the graph structure and data features, which can significantly increase the training difficulty and degrade their performance. Similarly, a hypergraph is a highly complex structure, and partitioning a hypergraph is a challenging task. This paper leverages spectral adversarial robustness evaluation to effectively address key challenges in complex-graph algorithms. By using spectral adversarial robustness evaluation to distinguish robust nodes from non-robust ones and treating them differently, we propose a training-set construction strategy that improves the training quality of GNNs. In addition, we develop algorithms to enhance both the adversarial robustness of GNNs and the performance of hypergraph partitioning. Experimental results show that this series of methods is highly effective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Urban Spaces: Interpolating Citywide Traffic Volume](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06292v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume forecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying them to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks exhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed with many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains unclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph Neural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume estimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation, integrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function tailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we introduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering different transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York City taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation methods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence) and remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. For example, on the Strava dataset, the MAE increases only from 7.1 to 10.5, and on the Taxi dataset, from 23.0 to 40.4. These results demonstrate that GNNUI maintains strong performance despite extreme data scarcity, a common condition in real-world urban settings. We also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATLAS: Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14908v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, their complex structures and inner workings can be challenging for non-AI experts to understand. To address this issue, this study presents \name{}, an educational visualization tool for interactive learning of GNNs. GNN 101 introduces a set of animated visualizations that seamlessly integrate mathematical formulas with visualizations via multiple levels of abstraction, including a model overview, layer operations, and detailed calculations.

| **[A Roadmap for Applying Graph Neural Networks to Numerical Data: Insights from Cementitious Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14855v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly applied in concrete research to optimize performance and mixture design. However, one major challenge in applying ML to cementitious materials is the limited size and diversity of available databases. A promising solution is the development of multi-modal databases that integrate both numerical and graphical data. Conventional ML frameworks in cement research are typically restricted to a single data modality. Graph neural network (GNN) represents a new generation of neural architectures capable of learning from data structured as graphs, capturing relationships through irregular or topology-dependent connections rather than fixed spatial coordinates. While GNN is inherently designed for graphical data, they can be adapted to extract correlations from numerical datasets and potentially embed physical laws directly into their architecture, enabling explainable and physics-informed predictions. This work is among the first few studies to implement GNNs to design concrete, with a particular emphasis on establishing a clear and reproducible pathway for converting tabular data into graph representations using the k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) approach. Model hyperparameters and feature selection are systematically optimized to enhance prediction performance. The GNN shows performance comparable to the benchmark random forest, which has been demonstrated by many studies to yield reliable predictions for cementitious materials. Overall, this study provides a foundational roadmap for transitioning from traditional ML to advanced AI architectures. The proposed framework establishes a strong foundation for future multi-modal and physics-informed GNN models capable of capturing complex material behaviors and accelerating the design and optimization of cementitious materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[TomoGraphView: 3D Medical Image Classification with Omnidirectional Slice Representations and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09605v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis (MedIA)</p></details> |

One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Based Forensic Framework for Inferring Hardware Noise of Cloud Quantum Backend](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14541v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud quantum platforms give users access to many backends with different qubit technologies, coupling layouts, and noise levels. The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven RCA methods are typically limited to offline applications due to high computational demands, and existing online RCA methods handle only single-modal data, overlooking complex interactions in multi-modal systems. In this paper, we introduce OCEAN, a novel online multi-modal causal structure learning method for root cause localization. OCEAN employs a dilated convolutional neural network to capture long-term temporal dependencies and graph neural networks to learn causal relationships among system entities and key performance indicators. We further design a multi-factor attention mechanism to analyze and reassess the relationships among different metrics and log indicators/attributes for enhanced online causal graph learning. Additionally, a contrastive mutual information maximization-based graph fusion module is developed to effectively model the relationships across various modalities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BigData 2025</p></details> |

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[GALAX: Graph-Augmented Language Model for Explainable Reinforcement-Guided Subgraph Reasoning in Precision Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20935v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context, and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN and schema-based rule check, enabling process-level supervision without explicit labels. As an application, we also introduced Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines, which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target discovery in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |

While scene graphs offer a structured abstraction of surgical events, their full potential remains untapped. In this work, we introduce ProtoFlow, a novel framework that learns dynamic scene graph prototypes to model complex surgical workflows in an interpretable and robust manner. Methods: ProtoFlow leverages a graph neural network (GNN) encoder-decoder architecture that combines self-supervised pretraining for rich representation learning with a prototype-based fine-tuning stage. This process discovers and refines core prototypes that encapsulate recurring, clinically meaningful patterns of surgical interaction, forming an explainable foundation for workflow analysis. Results: We evaluate our approach on the fine-grained CAT-SG dataset. ProtoFlow not only outperforms standard GNN baselines in overall accuracy but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in limited-data, few-shot scenarios, maintaining strong performance when trained on as few as one surgical video. Our qualitative analyses further show that the learned prototypes successfully identify distinct surgical sub-techniques and provide clear, interpretable insights into workflow deviations and rare complications. Conclusion: By uniting robust representation learning with inherent explainability, ProtoFlow represents a significant step toward developing more transparent, reliable, and data-efficient AI systems, accelerating their potential for clinical adoption in surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Hybrid Euclidean-SPD Manifold Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14023v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting plays a vital role in various real-world applications, such as traffic management and predictive maintenance. Existing approaches typically model MTS data in either Euclidean or Riemannian space, limiting their ability to capture the diverse geometric structures and complex spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in real-world data. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Hybrid Symmetric Positive-Definite Manifold Graph Neural Network (HSMGNN), a novel graph neural network-based model that captures data geometry within a hybrid Euclidean-Riemannian framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage hybrid geometric representations for MTS forecasting, enabling expressive and comprehensive modeling of geometric properties. Specifically, we introduce a Submanifold-Cross-Segment (SCS) embedding to project input MTS into both Euclidean and Riemannian spaces, thereby capturing spatio-temporal variations across distinct geometric domains. To alleviate the high computational cost of Riemannian distance, we further design an Adaptive-Distance-Bank (ADB) layer with a trainable memory mechanism. Finally, a Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN) is devised to integrate features from the dual spaces via a learnable fusion operator for accurate prediction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSMGNN achieves up to a 13.8 percent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

These models extend traditional message-passing GNNs and Transformers by representing node and edge features as spherical tensors that transform under irreducible representations of the rotation group SO(3), ensuring that predictions change in physically meaningful ways under rotations of the input. This guide develops a complete, intuitive foundation for spherical equivariant modeling - from group representations and spherical harmonics, to tensor products, Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, and the construction of SO(3)-equivariant kernels. Building on this foundation, we construct the Tensor Field Network and SE(3)-Transformer architectures and explain how they perform equivariant message-passing and attention on geometric graphs. Through clear mathematical derivations and annotated code excerpts, this guide serves as a self-contained introduction for researchers and learners seeking to understand or implement spherical EGNNs for applications in chemistry, molecular property prediction, protein structure modeling, and generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a technical version of the article originally published in Alchemy Bio (99 pages, 46 figures)</p></details> |

We propose a novel framework that integrates persistent homology features with stability regularization to enhance robustness. Building on the stability theorems of persistent homology \cite{cohen2007stability}, our method combines GIN architectures with multi-scale topological features extracted from persistence images, enforced by Hiraoka-Kusano-inspired stability constraints. Across six diverse datasets spanning biochemical, social, and collaboration networks , our approach demonstrates exceptional robustness to edge perturbations while maintaining competitive accuracy. Notably, we observe minimal performance degradation (0-4\% on most datasets) under perturbation, significantly outperforming baseline stability. Our work provides both a theoretically-grounded and empirically-validated approach to robust graph learning that aligns with recent advances in topological regularization</p></details> |  |

We introduce LightTopoGAT, a lightweight graph attention network that enhances node features through topological augmentation by incorporating node degree and local clustering coefficient to improve graph representation learning. The proposed approach maintains parameter efficiency through streamlined attention mechanisms while integrating structural information that is typically overlooked by local message passing schemes. Through comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, MUTAG, ENZYMES, and PROTEINS, we show that LightTopoGAT achieves superior performance compared to established baselines including GCN, GraphSAGE, and standard GAT, with a 6.6 percent improvement in accuracy on MUTAG and a 2.2 percent improvement on PROTEINS. Ablation studies further confirm that these performance gains arise directly from the inclusion of topological features, demonstrating a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing graph neural network performance without increasing architectural complexity.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[The prediction of the quality of results in Logic Synthesis using Transformer and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11437v3)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the logic synthesis stage, structure transformations in the synthesis tool need to be combined into optimization sequences and act on the circuit to meet the specified circuit area and delay. However, logic synthesis optimization sequences are time-consuming to run, and predicting the quality of the results (QoR) against the synthesis optimization sequence for a circuit can help engineers find a better optimization sequence faster. In this work, we propose a deep learning method to predict the QoR of unseen circuit-optimization sequences pairs. Specifically, the structure transformations are translated into vectors by embedding methods and advanced natural language processing (NLP) technology (Transformer) is used to extract the features of the optimization sequences. In addition, to enable the prediction process of the model to be generalized from circuit to circuit, the graph representation of the circuit is represented as an adjacency matrix and a feature matrix. Graph neural networks(GNN) are used to extract the structural features of the circuits. For this problem, the Transformer and three typical GNNs are used. Furthermore, the Transformer and GNNs are adopted as a joint learning policy for the QoR prediction of the unseen circuit-optimization sequences. The methods resulting from the combination of Transformer and GNNs are benchmarked. The experimental results show that the joint learning of Transformer and GraphSage gives the best results. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the predicted result is 0.412.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta Pruning via Graph Metanetworks : A Universal Meta Learning Framework for Network Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12041v3)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an entirely new meta-learning framework for network pruning. It is a general framework that can be theoretically applied to almost all types of networks with all kinds of pruning and has great generality and transferability. Experiments have shown that it can achieve outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including both CNNs and Transformers). Unlike all prior works that either rely on fixed, hand-crafted criteria to prune in a coarse manner, or employ learning to prune ways that require special training during each pruning and lack generality. Our framework can learn complex pruning rules automatically via a neural network (metanetwork) and has great generality that can prune without any special training. More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically and can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and some standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yewei-Liu/MetaPruning</p></details> |  |

While forecasting models generally disregard unmonitored roads by design, spatial imputation methods explicitly address network-wide estimation; yet this approach relies on volume data at inference time, limiting its applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive ablation studies that demonstrate the model's capacity to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and highlight the value of topological information for accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation without relying on volume data at inference time.</p></details> |  |

We view an optimizer as a short program over a small vocabulary of search operators and learn this operator program separately for each problem instance. We instantiate this idea in Operator-Programmed Algorithms (OPAL), a landscape-aware framework for continuous black-box optimization that uses a small design budget with a standard differential evolution baseline to probe the landscape, builds a $k$-nearest neighbor graph over sampled points, and encodes this trajectory with a graph neural network. A meta-learner then maps the resulting representation to a phase-wise schedule of exploration, restart, and local search operators. On the CEC~2017 test suite, a single meta-trained OPAL policy is statistically competitive with state-of-the-art adaptive differential evolution variants and achieves significant improvements over simpler baselines under nonparametric tests. Ablation studies on CEC~2017 justify the choices for the design phase, the trajectory graph, and the operator-program representation, while the meta-components add only modest wall-clock overhead. Overall, the results indicate that operator-programmed, landscape-aware per-instance design is a practical way forward beyond ad hoc metaphor-based algorithms in black-box optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code, experiment scripts, and results are publicly available at https://github.com/junbolian/OPAL.

This work proposes a graph-based framework that models Urdu novels as character interaction networks to examine whether authorial style can be inferred from narrative structure alone. Each novel is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to characters and edges denote their co-occurrence within narrative proximity. We systematically compare multiple graph representations, including global structural features, node-level semantic summaries, unsupervised graph embeddings, and supervised graph neural networks. Experiments on a dataset of 52 Urdu novels written by seven authors show that learned graph representations substantially outperform hand-crafted and unsupervised baselines, achieving up to 0.857 accuracy under a strict author-aware evaluation protocol.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Yet, Hessians are computationally expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks.

In this paper, we present tgp's structure and present an extensive benchmark. The latter showcases the library's features and systematically compares the performance of the implemented graph-pooling methods in different downstream tasks. The results, showing that the choice of the optimal pooling operator depends on tasks and data at hand, support the need for a library that enables fast prototyping.</p></details> |  |

DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-Based Trust Evaluation Network) introduces a unified graph-based framework that does all three by combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To track how trust evolves, it layers hybrid absolute-Gaussian-hourglass positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, then applies an ordinary differential equation-based residual learning module to jointly model abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary cosine and Jaccard similarity, curbing reputation laundering, sabotage, and on-off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN delivers standout gains where it matters most: in single-timeslot prediction on Bitcoin-OTC, it improves MCC by +12.34% over the best dynamic baseline; in the cold-start scenario on Bitcoin-Alpha, it achieves a +25.00% MCC improvement, the largest across all tasks and datasets; while under adversarial on-off attacks, it surpasses the baseline by up to +10.23% MCC. These results endorse the unified DGTEN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We present Graph of Molecule Substructures (GoMS), a novel architecture that explicitly models the interactions and spatial arrangements between molecular substructures. Unlike ESAN's bag-based representation, GoMS constructs a graph where nodes represent subgraphs and edges capture their structural relationships, preserving critical topological information about how substructures are connected and overlap within the molecule. Through extensive experiments on public molecular datasets, we demonstrate that GoMS outperforms ESAN and other baseline methods, with particularly improvements for large molecules containing more than 100 atoms. The performance gap widens as molecular size increases, demonstrating GoMS's effectiveness for modeling industrial-scale molecules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GoMS can distinguish molecules with identical subgraph compositions but different spatial arrangements. Our approach shows particular promise for materials science applications involving complex molecules where properties emerge from the interplay between multiple functional units. By capturing substructure relationships that are lost in bag-based approaches, GoMS represents a significant advance toward scalable and interpretable molecular property prediction for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26032v2)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[High-Dimensional Tensor Discriminant Analysis: Low-Rank Discriminant Structure, Representation Synergy, and Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12122v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional tensor-valued predictors arise in modern applications, increasingly as learned representations from neural networks. Existing tensor classification methods rely on sparsity or Tucker structures and often lack theoretical guarantees. Motivated by empirical evidence that discriminative signals concentrate along a few multilinear components, we introduce CP low-rank structure for the discriminant tensor, a modeling perspective not previously explored. Under a Tensor Gaussian Mixture Model, we propose high-dimensional CP low-rank Tensor Discriminant Analysis (CP-TDA) with Randomized Composite PCA (\textsc{rc-PCA}) initialization, that is essential for handling dependent and anisotropic noise under weaker signal strength and incoherence conditions, followed by iterative refinement algorithm. We establish global convergence and minimax-optimal misclassification rates. To handle tensor data deviating from tensor normality, we develop the first semiparametric tensor discriminant model, in which learned tensor representations are mapped via deep generative models into a latent space tailored for CP-TDA. Misclassification risk decomposes into representation, approximation, and estimation errors. Numerical studies and real data analysis on graph classification demonstrate substantial gains over existing tensor classifiers and state-of-the-art graph neural networks, particularly in high-dimensional, small-sample regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Fraud Detection: Integrating Reinforcement Learning into Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09892v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial fraud refers to the act of obtaining financial benefits through dishonest means. Such behavior not only disrupts the order of the financial market but also harms economic and social development and breeds other illegal and criminal activities. With the popularization of the internet and online payment methods, many fraudulent activities and money laundering behaviors in life have shifted from offline to online, posing a great challenge to regulatory authorities. How to efficiently detect these financial fraud activities has become an urgent issue that needs to be resolved. Graph neural networks are a type of deep learning model that can utilize the interactive relationships within graph structures, and they have been widely applied in the field of fraud detection. However, there are still some issues. First, fraudulent activities only account for a very small part of transaction transfers, leading to an inevitable problem of label imbalance in fraud detection. At the same time, fraudsters often disguise their behavior, which can have a negative impact on the final prediction results. In addition, existing research has overlooked the importance of balancing neighbor information and central node information. For example, when the central node has too many neighbors, the features of the central node itself are often neglected. Finally, fraud activities and patterns are constantly changing over time, so considering the dynamic evolution of graph edge relationships is also very important.</p></details> | <details><summary>I req...</summary><p>I request the withdrawal of this paper because serious concerns have been identified regarding the originality of the manuscript, and the authors suspect that the fifth author may have engaged in plagiarism, including the possible use of unpublished results from a manuscript affiliated with Donghua University</p></details> |
| **[Generative Graph Pattern Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16130v3)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance. To this end, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable and transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node/link/graph classification, transfer learning, and cross-graph pretraining -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/G2PM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents Hash based Multi-phase SpGEMM on GPU and the Acceleration of Indirect Memory Access (AIA) technique, a novel custom near-memory processing approach to optimizing SpGEMM on GPU HBM. Our hardware-software co-designed framework for SpGEMM demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling complex, application-specific workloads. We evaluate our approach on various graph workloads, including graph contraction, Markov clustering, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), showcasing its practical applicability. For graph analytics applications, AIA demonstrates up to 17.3% time reduction from the software-only implementation, while achieving time reduction of 76.5% for Graph Contraction and 58.4% for Markov Clustering compared to cuSPARSE. For GNN training applications with structured global pruning, our hybrid approach delivers an average of 1.43x speedup over software-only implementation across six benchmark datasets and three architectures (GCN, GIN, GraphSAGE), and shows 1.95x speedup for GNN workloads when compared to cuSPARSE, with up to 4.18x gains on large-scale datasets.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Exploring Spatial-Temporal Representation via Star Graph for mmWave Radar-based Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12013v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human activity recognition (HAR) requires extracting accurate spatial-temporal features with human movements. A mmWave radar point cloud-based HAR system suffers from sparsity and variable-size problems due to the physical features of the mmWave signal. Existing works usually borrow the preprocessing algorithms for the vision-based systems with dense point clouds, which may not be optimal for mmWave radar systems. In this work, we proposed a graph representation with a discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) to explore the spatial-temporal representation of human movement-related features. Specifically, we designed a star graph to describe the high-dimensional relative relationship between a manually added static center point and the dynamic mmWave radar points in the same and consecutive frames. We then adopted DDGNN to learn the features residing in the star graph with variable sizes. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed other baseline methods using real-world HAR datasets. Our system achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.27\%, which gets the near-optimal performance with a vision-based skeleton data accuracy of 97.25\%. We also conducted an inference test on Raspberry Pi~4 to demonstrate its effectiveness on resource-constraint platforms. \sh{ We provided a comprehensive ablation study for variable DDGNN structures to validate our model design. Our system also outperformed three recent radar-specific methods without requiring resampling or frame aggregators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Data and Physics: A Graph Neural Network-Based Hybrid Twin Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15767v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Text2Graph: Combining Lightweight LLMs and GNNs for Efficient Text Classification in Label-Scarce Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10061v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become effective zero-shot classifiers, but their high computational requirements and environmental costs limit their practicality for large-scale annotation in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. To support more sustainable workflows, we present Text2Graph, an open-source Python package that provides a modular implementation of existing text-to-graph classification approaches. The framework enables users to combine LLM-based partial annotation with Graph Neural Network (GNN) label propagation in a flexible manner, making it straightforward to swap components such as feature extractors, edge construction methods, and sampling strategies. We benchmark Text2Graph on a zero-shot setting using five datasets spanning topic classification and sentiment analysis tasks, comparing multiple variants against other zero-shot approaches for text classification. In addition to reporting performance, we provide detailed estimates of energy consumption and carbon emissions, showing that graph-based propagation achieves competitive results at a fraction of the energy and environmental cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Embedding with Mel-spectrograms for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11545v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is extremely challenging due to the complexity of ship-radiated noise and the variability of ocean environments. Although deep learning (DL) approaches have achieved promising results, most existing models implicitly assume that underwater acoustic data lie in a Euclidean space. This assumption, however, is unsuitable for the inherently complex topology of underwater acoustic signals, which exhibit non-stationary, non-Gaussian, and nonlinear characteristics. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the UATR-GTransformer, a non-Euclidean DL model that integrates Transformer architectures with graph neural networks (GNNs). The model comprises three key components: a Mel patchify block, a GTransformer block, and a classification head. The Mel patchify block partitions the Mel-spectrogram into overlapping patches, while the GTransformer block employs a Transformer Encoder to capture mutual information between split patches to generate Mel-graph embeddings. Subsequently, a GNN enhances these embeddings by modeling local neighborhood relationships, and a feed-forward network (FFN) further performs feature transformation. Experiments results based on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the UATR-GTransformer achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, interpretability analysis reveals that the proposed model effectively extracts rich frequency-domain information, highlighting its potential for applications in ocean engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAT: Can Trust be Predicted with Context-Awareness in Dynamic Heterogeneous Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11352v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trust prediction provides valuable support for decision-making, risk mitigation, and system security enhancement. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained. To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CAT outperforms five groups of baselines in trust prediction, while exhibiting strong scalability to large-scale graphs and robustness against both trust-oriented and GNN-oriented attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Condensation-Concatenation Framework for Dynamic Graph Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11317v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs are prevalent in real-world scenarios, where continuous structural changes induce catastrophic forgetting in graph neural networks (GNNs). While continual learning has been extended to dynamic graphs, existing methods overlook the effects of topological changes on existing nodes. To address it, we propose a novel framework for continual learning on dynamic graphs, named Condensation-Concatenation-based Continual Learning (CCC). Specifically, CCC first condenses historical graph snapshots into compact semantic representations while aiming to preserve the original label distribution and topological properties. Then it concatenates these historical embeddings with current graph representations selectively. Moreover, we refine the forgetting measure (FM) to better adapt to dynamic graph scenarios by quantifying the predictive performance degradation of existing nodes caused by structural updates. CCC demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines across four real-world datasets in extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
