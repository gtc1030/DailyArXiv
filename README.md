| **[Plug-and-Play Benchmarking of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Large-Scale Flow Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15015v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in active flow control (AFC), yet progress in the field remains difficult to assess as existing studies rely on heterogeneous observation and actuation schemes, numerical setups, and evaluation protocols. Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources. FluidGym enables systematic comparison of control methods, establishes a scalable foundation for future research in learning-based flow control, and is available at https://github.com/safe-autonomous-systems/fluidgym.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/safe-autonomous-systems/fluidgym</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Partner Project: Multi-GPU Performance Portability Analysis for CFD Simulations at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14159v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As heterogeneous supercomputing architectures leveraging GPUs become increasingly central to high-performance computing (HPC), it is crucial for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, a de-facto HPC workload, to efficiently utilize such hardware. One of the key challenges of HPC codes is performance portability, i.e. the ability to maintain near-optimal performance across different accelerators. In the context of the \textbf{REFMAP} project, which targets scalable, GPU-enabled multi-fidelity CFD for urban airflow prediction, this paper analyzes the performance portability of SOD2D, a state-of-the-art Spectral Elements simulation framework across AMD and NVIDIA GPU architectures. We first discuss the physical and numerical models underlying SOD2D, highlighting its computational hotspots. Then, we examine its performance and scalability in a multi-level manner, i.e. defining and characterizing an extensive full-stack design space spanning across application, software and hardware infrastructure related parameters. Single-GPU performance characterization across server-grade NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures and vendor-specific compiler stacks, show the potential as well as the diverse effect of memory access optimizations, i.e. 0.69$\times$ - 3.91$\times$ deviations in acceleration speedup. Performance variability of SOD2D at scale is further examined on the LUMI multi-GPU cluster, where profiling reveals similar throughput variations, highlighting the limits of performance projections and the need for multi-level, informed tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>DATE ...</summary><p>DATE 26 conference Multi-Partner Project Paper</p></details> |
| **[Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16417v4)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von Kármán vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Solve Optimization Problems Constrained with Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24573v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables, and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints. This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation, heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaggerFFT: A Distributed FFT Framework Using Task Scheduling in Julia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12209v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a fundamental numerical technique with widespread application in a range of scientific problems. As scientific simulations attempt to exploit exascale systems, there has been a growing demand for distributed FFT algorithms that can effectively utilize modern heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Conventional FFT algorithms commonly encounter performance bottlenecks, especially when run on heterogeneous platforms. Most distributed FFT approaches rely on static task distribution and require synchronization barriers, limiting scalability and impacting overall resource utilization. In this paper we present DaggerFFT, a distributed FFT framework, developed in Julia, that treats highly parallel FFT computations as a dynamically scheduled task graph. Each FFT stage operates on a separately defined distributed array. FFT operations are expressed as DTasks operating on pencil or slab partitioned DArrays. Each FFT stage owns its own DArray, and the runtime assigns DTasks across devices using Dagger's dynamic scheduler that uses work stealing. We demonstrate how DaggerFFT's dynamic scheduler can outperform state-of-the-art distributed FFT libraries on both CPU and GPU backends, achieving up to a 2.6x speedup on CPU clusters and up to a 1.35x speedup on GPU clusters. We have integrated DaggerFFT into Oceananigans.jl, a geophysical fluid dynamics framework, demonstrating that high-level, task-based runtimes can deliver both superior performance and modularity in large-scale, real-world simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code2MCP: Transforming Code Repositories into MCP Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05941v3)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) aims to create a standard for how Large Language Models use tools. However, most current research focuses on selecting tools from an existing pool. A more fundamental, yet largely overlooked, problem is how to populate this pool by converting the vast number of existing software projects into MCP-compatible services. To bridge this gap, we introduce Code2MCP, an agent-based framework that automatically transforms a GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Code2MCP employs a multi-agent workflow for code analysis, environment setup, tool function design, and service generation, enhanced by a self-correcting loop to ensure reliability. We demonstrate that Code2MCP successfully transforms open-source computing libraries in scientific fields such as bioinformatics, mathematics, and fluid dynamics that are not available in existing MCP servers. By providing a novel automated pathway to unlock GitHub, the world's largest code repository, for the MCP ecosystem, Code2MCP serves as a catalyst to significantly accelerate the protocol's adoption and practical application. The code is public at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/Code2MCP.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Quadrupedal Locomotion for a Heavy Hydraulic Robot Using an Actuator Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11143v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer of large-scale hydraulic robots presents a significant challenge in robotics because of the inherent slow control response and complex fluid dynamics. The complex dynamics result from the multiple interconnected cylinder structure and the difference in fluid rates of the cylinders. These characteristics complicate detailed simulation for all joints, making it unsuitable for reinforcement learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose an analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics to represent the complicated actuators. The model predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, allowing rapid processing in RL environments. We compare our model with neural network-based actuator models and demonstrate the advantages of our model in data-limited scenarios. The locomotion policy trained in RL with our model is deployed on a hydraulic quadruped robot, which is over 300 kg. This work is the first demonstration of a successful transfer of stable and robust command-tracking locomotion with RL on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, demonstrating advanced sim-to-real transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition from Mode Extraction to Dimensional Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11116v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CR-DMD), a novel framework that robustifies the entire DMD process - from mode extraction to dimensional reduction - against mixed noise. Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes. Both stages are efficiently solved by a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets demonstrate that CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in terms of mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing.

| **[SPIKE: Sparse Koopman Regularization for Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10282v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A reduced-order derivative-informed neural operator for subsurface fluid-flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13620v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[VICON: Vision In-Context Operator Networks for Multi-Physics Fluid Dynamics Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16063v5)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) have demonstrated the ability to learn operators across diverse partial differential equations using few-shot, in-context learning. However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications. Our scripts for processing datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Eydcao/VICON.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update after TMLR accept</p></details> |
| **[A Mesh-Adaptive Hypergraph Neural Network for Unsteady Flow Around Oscillating and Rotating Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22252v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks, recently introduced into the field of fluid flow surrogate modeling, have been successfully applied to model the temporal evolution of various fluid flow systems. Existing applications, however, are mostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work extends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow around structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we propose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate model with part of the mesh/graph co-rotating with the structure and part of the mesh/graph static. A single layer of interface cells are constructed at the interface between the two parts and are allowed to distort and adapt, which helps in circumventing the difficulty of interpolating information encoded by the neural network at every graph neural network layer. Dedicated reconstruction and re-projection schemes are designed to counter the error caused by the distortion and connectivity change of the interface cells. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow around a 2D oscillating airfoil, and (ii) fluid flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model achieves stable rollout predictions over hundreds or even a thousand time steps. We further demonstrate that one could enforce accurate, error-bounded prediction results by incorporating the measurements from sparse pressure sensors. In addition to the accurate flow field predictions, the lift and drag force predictions closely match with the computational fluid dynamics calculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling fluid flow around rotating structures, and paving the path towards a graph neural network-based surrogate model for more complex scenarios like flow around marine propellers.</p></details> |  |
| **[PINGS-X: Physics-Informed Normalized Gaussian Splatting with Axes Alignment for Efficient Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11048v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026.

| **[SwarmFoam: An OpenFOAM Multi-Agent System Based on Multiple Types of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07252v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulation is one of the mainstream methods in scientific research, typically performed by professional engineers. With the advancement of multi-agent technology, using collaborating agents to replicate human behavior shows immense potential for intelligent Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Some muti-agent systems based on Large Language Models have been proposed. However, they exhibit significant limitations when dealing with complex geometries. This paper introduces a new multi-agent simulation framework, SwarmFoam. SwarmFoam integrates functionalities such as Multi-modal perception, Intelligent error correction, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, aiming to achieve more complex simulations through dual parsing of images and high-level instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that SwarmFoam has good adaptability to simulation inputs from different modalities. The overall pass rate for 25 test cases was 84%, with natural language and multi-modal input cases achieving pass rates of 80% and 86.7%, respectively. The work presented by SwarmFoam will further promote the development of intelligent agent methods for CFD.</p></details> | 26 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Low-Latency Event-Based Velocimetry for Quadrotor Control in a Narrow Pipe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15444v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels presents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic disturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement learning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow, circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[The Equilibrium Response of Atmospheric Machine-Learning Models to Uniform Sea Surface Temperature Warming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02415v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models for the global atmosphere that are capable of producing stable, multi-year simulations of Earth's climate have recently been developed. However, the ability of these ML models to generalize beyond the training distribution remains an open question. In this study, we evaluate the climate response of several state-of-the-art ML models (ACE2-ERA5, NeuralGCM, and cBottle) to a uniform sea surface temperature warming, a widely used benchmark for evaluating climate change. We assess each ML model's performance relative to a physics-based general circulation model (NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory AM4) across key diagnostics, including surface air temperature, precipitation, temperature and wind profiles, and top-of-atmosphere radiation. While the ML models reproduce key aspects of the physical model response, particularly the response of precipitation, some exhibit notable departures from robust physical responses, including radiative responses and land region warming. Our results highlight the promise and current limitations of ML models for climate change applications and suggest that further improvements are needed for robust out-of-sample generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding diffusion models to reconstruct flow fields from sparse data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19971v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of unsteady flow fields from limited measurements is a challenging and crucial task for many engineering applications. Machine learning models are gaining popularity for solving this problem due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data and to generalize across diverse conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as being particularly powerful for generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for leveraging them in fluid dynamics research and applications ranging from super-resolution to reconstructions of experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Physics of Fluids, code and data can be found at https://github.com/tum-pbs/sparse-reconstruction</p></details> |
| **[Multi-fidelity graph-based neural networks architectures to learn Navier-Stokes solutions on non-parametrized 2D domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02157v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a graph-based, multi-fidelity learning framework for the prediction of stationary Navier--Stokes solutions in non-parametrized two-dimensional geometries. The method is designed to guide the learning process through successive approximations, starting from reduced-order and full Stokes models, and progressively approaching the Navier--Stokes solution. To effectively capture both local and long-range dependencies in the velocity and pressure fields, we combine graph neural networks with Transformer and Mamba architectures. While Transformers achieve the highest accuracy, we show that Mamba can be successfully adapted to graph-structured data through an unsupervised node-ordering strategy. The Mamba approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Physical knowledge is embedded directly into the architecture through an encoding -- processing -- physics informed decoding pipeline. Derivatives are computed through algebraic operators constructed via the Weighted Least Squares method. The flexibility of these operators allows us not only to make the output obey the governing equations, but also to constrain selected hidden features to satisfy mass conservation. We introduce additional physical biases through an enriched graph convolution with the same differential operators describing the PDEs. Overall, we successfully guide the learning process by physical knowledge and fluid dynamics insights, leading to more regular and accurate predictions</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11320v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) power many modern applications, but their inference procedure poses unique scheduling challenges: the Key-Value (KV) cache grows dynamically during response generation, and memory overflow triggers eviction that can cascade into system-wide failures. Even when memory capacity exceeds the theoretical requirement, conventional scheduling algorithms fail because they do not account for this dynamic memory growth -- a system that should be stable can become unstable under poor scheduling. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to establish a tractable benchmark and derive the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm. WAIT uses threshold-based batching to prevent eviction by keeping the system near load balance, achieving near-optimal throughput when output lengths are known. For practical settings where output lengths are unknown at arrival, we introduce Nested WAIT. Rather than predicting output lengths, Nested WAIT classifies prompts on-the-fly: short prompts complete early and exit, while longer prompts naturally advance to later segments. A safety buffer provides high-probability protection against memory overflow with only logarithmic overhead. Theoretical analysis establishes near-optimal performance in the asymptotic regime. Experiments on Llama-7B with an A100 GPU demonstrate that our approach achieves superior throughput and reduced latency compared to vLLM and Sarathi. This work applies operations research principles to establish a theoretical framework for LLM deployment under memory constraints.</p></details> | 49 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Car Drag Coefficient Prediction from 3D Point Clouds Using a Slice-Based Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02112v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automotive industry's pursuit of enhanced fuel economy and performance necessitates efficient aerodynamic design. However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Uncertainty Quantification of Surrogate Models using Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09881v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven surrogate models offer quick approximations to complex numerical and experimental systems but typically lack uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. While Bayesian methods provide uncertainty estimates, they offer no statistical guarantees and struggle with high-dimensional spatio-temporal problems due to computational costs. We present a conformal prediction (CP) framework that provides statistically guaranteed marginal coverage for surrogate models in a model-agnostic manner with near-zero computational cost. Our approach handles high-dimensional spatio-temporal outputs by performing cell-wise calibration while preserving the tensorial structure of predictions. Through extensive empirical evaluation across diverse applications including fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, weather forecasting, and fusion diagnostics, we demonstrate that CP achieves empirical coverage with valid error bars regardless of model architecture, training regime, or output dimensionality. We evaluate three nonconformity scores (conformalised quantile regression, absolute error residual, and standard deviation) for both deterministic and probabilistic models, showing that guaranteed coverage holds even for out-of-distribution predictions where models are deployed on physics regimes different from training data. Calibration requires only seconds to minutes on standard hardware. The framework enables rigorous validation of pre-trained surrogate models for downstream applications without retraining. While CP provides marginal rather than conditional coverage and assumes exchangeability between calibration and test data, our method circumvents the curse of dimensionality inherent in traditional uncertainty quantification approaches, offering a practical tool for trustworthy deployment of machine learning in physical sciences.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free). Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors. Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems, including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Here, practical AI assistance requires the seamless integration of domain literature knowledge with robust execution capabilities for expertise-intensive tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlamePilot, an LLM agent designed to empower combustion modeling research through automated and self-corrective CFD workflows. FlamePilot differentiates itself through an architecture that leverages atomic tools to ensure the robust setup and execution of complex simulations in both OpenFOAM and extended frameworks such as DeepFlame. The system is also capable of learning from scientific articles, extracting key information to guide the simulation from initial setup to optimized results. Validation on a public benchmark shows FlamePilot achieved a perfect 1.0 executability score and a 0.438 success rate, surpassing the prior best reported agent scores of 0.625 and 0.250, respectively. Furthermore, a detailed case study on Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion simulation demonstrates its efficacy as a collaborative research copilot, where FlamePilot autonomously translated a research paper into a configured simulation, conducted the simulation, post-processed the results, proposed evidence-based refinements, and managed a multi-step parameter study to convergence under minimal human intervention. By adopting a transparent and interpretable paradigm, FlamePilot establishes a foundational framework for AI-empowered combustion modeling, fostering a collaborative partnership where the agent manages workflow orchestration, freeing the researcher for high-level analysis.</p></details> |  |

It is commonly employed to analyze complex flow structures and validate numerical simulations. This study explores the untapped potential of spike cameras--ultra-high-speed, high-dynamic-range vision sensors--in high-speed fluid velocimetry. We propose a deep learning framework, Spike Imaging Velocimetry (SIV), tailored for high-resolution fluid motion estimation. To enhance the network's performance, we design three novel modules specifically adapted to the characteristics of fluid dynamics and spike streams: the Detail-Preserving Hierarchical Transform (DPHT), the Graph Encoder (GE), and the Multi-scale Velocity Refinement (MSVR). Furthermore, we introduce a spike-based PIV dataset, Particle Scenes with Spike and Displacement (PSSD), which contains labeled samples from three representative fluid-dynamics scenarios: steady turbulence, high-speed flow, and high-dynamic-range conditions. Our proposed method outperforms existing baselines across all these scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in AAAI-26 proceedings</p></details> |

The model extends the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations to account for the electric properties of the flowing plasma gas and its reaction to the applied magnetic field. The model takes into account various effects, such as the Lorentz force, turbulence, compressibility, and energy extraction from the plasma, and it adopts an electric potential technique along with the low magnetic Reynolds number (Rem) approximation. The model is numerically implemented using the multiphysics open-source computer programming environment "OpenFOAM," which combines the finite volume method (FVM) and the object-oriented programming (OOP) concept. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated by simulating the supersonic channel of the large-scale pulsed MHD generator (PMHDG) called "Sakhalin", with the aid of collected data and empirical expressions in the literature about its tested operation. Sakhalin was the world's largest PMHDG, with a demonstrated peak electric power output of 510 MW. Sakhalin operated on solid-propellant plasma (SPP), and it had a single supersonic divergent Faraday-type continuous-electrode channel with a length of 4.5 m. We check the validity of the model through comparisons with independent results for the Sakhalin PMHDG. Then, we process our three-dimensional simulation results to provide scalar characteristics of the Sakhalin channel, one-dimensional profiles along the longitudinal centerline, and three-dimensional distributions in the entire channel.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 22 figures, 6 tables, published journal article, peer-reviewed, open access</p></details> |

However, solving the governing nonlinear perturbation velocity potential equation presents computational challenges. Traditional approaches often rely on linearized equations or finite, truncated domains, which introduce non-negligible errors and limit applicability in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel framework utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the full nonlinear compressible potential equation in an unbounded (infinite) domain. We address the unbounded-domain and convergence challenges inherent in standard PINNs by incorporating a coordinate transformation and embedding physical asymptotic constraints directly into the network architecture. Furthermore, we employ a Multi-Stage PINN (MS-PINN) approach to iteratively minimize residuals, achieving solution accuracy approaching machine precision. We validate this framework by simulating flow over circular and elliptical geometries, comparing our results against traditional finite-domain and linearized solutions. Our findings quantify the noticeable discrepancies introduced by domain truncation and linearization, particularly at higher Mach numbers, and demonstrate that this new framework is a robust, high-fidelity tool for computational fluid dynamics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing cuffless wearable devices for blood pressure (BP) monitoring often rely on methods lacking theoretical foundations, such as pulse wave analysis or pulse arrival time, making them vulnerable to physiological and experimental confounders that undermine their accuracy and clinical utility. Here, we developed a smartwatch device with real-time electrical bioimpedance (BioZ) sensing for cuffless hemodynamic monitoring. We elucidate the biophysical relationship between BioZ and BP via a multiscale analytical and computational modeling framework, and identify physiological, anatomical, and experimental parameters that influence the pulsatile BioZ signal at the wrist. A signal-tagged physics-informed neural network incorporating fluid dynamics principles enables calibration-free estimation of BP and radial and axial blood velocity. We successfully tested our approach with healthy individuals at rest and after physical activity including physical and autonomic challenges, and with patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease in outpatient and intensive care settings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of BioZ technology for cuffless BP and blood velocity monitoring, addressing critical limitations of existing cuffless technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>225 p...</summary><p>225 pages, Number of Main Figures 4, Number of Extended Data Tables 4, Number of Extended Data Figures 5, Number of Supplementary Figures 34, Number of Supplementary Tables 11, Number of Supplementary Videos 11, Supplementary Statistical Table 1 (Supplementary Table 12)</p></details> |

While recent work has explored quantum models for learning statistical properties of fluid systems, the combination of discrete latent space compression with quantum generative sampling for CFD remains unexplored. We develop a GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulator to generate fluid vorticity fields, which are compressed into a discrete 7-dimensional latent space using a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The central contribution is a comparative analysis of quantum and classical generative approaches for modeling this physics-derived latent distribution: we evaluate a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) against a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) baseline. Under our experimental conditions, both quantum models produced samples with lower average minimum distances to the true distribution compared to the LSTM, with the QCBM achieving the most favorable metrics. This work provides: (1)~a complete open-source pipeline bridging CFD simulation and quantum machine learning, (2)~the first empirical study of quantum generative modeling on compressed latent representations of physics simulations, and (3)~a foundation for future rigorous investigation at this intersection.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysicsCorrect: A Training-Free Approach for Stable Neural PDE Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02227v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation: error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three representative PDE systems, including Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5%). The framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures, including Fourier Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity demanded by practical scientific applications.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |
| **[Safe Path Planning and Observation Quality Enhancement Strategy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Water Quality Monitoring Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21375v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spectral remote sensing technology is widely used in water quality monitoring. However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on computational fluid dynamics or empirical correlations, while data-driven methods require extensive real flight data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. We present a simulation-based amortized inference approach that trains a neural network on synthetic flight data generated from a physics simulator, then applies the learned model to real flights without any fine-tuning. Our method learns to invert the forward physics model, directly predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from a single apogee measurement combined with motor and configuration features. In this proof-of-concept study, we train on 10,000 synthetic flights and evaluate on 8 real flights, achieving a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction - demonstrating promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training examples. Analysis reveals a systematic positive bias in predictions, providing quantitative insight into the gap between idealized physics and real-world flight conditions. We additionally compare against OpenRocket baseline predictions, showing that our learned approach reduces apogee prediction error.

| **[Self-Guided Diffusion Model for Accelerating Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04375v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning methods, such as diffusion models, are widely explored as a promising way to accelerate high-fidelity fluid dynamics computation via a super-resolution process from faster-to-compute low-fidelity input. However, existing approaches usually make impractical assumptions that the low-fidelity data is down-sampled from high-fidelity data. In reality, low-fidelity data is produced by numerical solvers that use a coarser resolution. Solver-generated low-fidelity data usually sacrifices fine-grained details, such as small-scale vortices compared to high-fidelity ones. Our findings show that SOTA diffusion models struggle to reconstruct fine-scale details when faced with solver-generated low-fidelity inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose SG-Diff, a novel diffusion model for reconstruction, where both low-fidelity inputs and high-fidelity targets are generated from numerical solvers. We propose an \textit{Importance Weight} strategy during training that serves as a form of self-guidance, focusing on intricate fluid details, and a \textit{Predictor-Corrector-Advancer} SDE solver that embeds physical guidance into the diffusion sampling process. Together, these techniques steer the diffusion model toward more accurate reconstructions. Experimental results on four 2D turbulent flow datasets demonstrate the efficacy of \model~against state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Critical Assessment of Pattern Comparisons Between POD and Autoencoders in Intraventricular Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19376v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

However, despite the widespread adoption of GPUs, programmability remains a challenge, particularly in open-source contexts. In this paper, we present SPUMA, a full GPU porting of OPENFOAM targeting NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The implementation strategy is based on a portable programming model and the adoption of a memory pool manager that leverages the unified memory feature of modern GPUs. This approach is discussed alongside several numerical tests conducted on two pre-exascale clusters in Europe, LUMI and Leonardo, which host AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs, respectively. In the performance analysis section, we present results related to memory usage profiling and kernel wall-time, the impact of the memory pool, and energy consumption obtained by simulating the well-known DrivAer industrial test case. GPU utilization strongly affects strong scalability results, reaching 65% efficiency on both LUMI and Leonardo when approaching a load of 8 million cells per GPU. Weak scalability results, obtained on 20 GPUs with the OpenFOAM native multigrid solver, range from 75% on Leonardo to 85% on LUMI. Notably, efficiency is no lower than 90% when switching to the NVIDIA AmgX linear algebra solver. Our tests also reveal that one A100 GPU on Leonardo is equivalent 200-300 Intel Sapphire Rapids cores, provided the GPUs are sufficiently oversubscribed (more than 10 million of cells per GPU). Finally, energy consumption is reduced by up to 82% compared to analogous simulations executed on CPUs.</p></details> | 43 pages |
| **[A Surrogate-Augmented Symbolic CFD-Driven Training Framework for Accelerating Multi-objective Physical Model Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19031v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-driven training combines machine learning (ML) with CFD solvers to develop physically consistent closure models with improved predictive accuracy. In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach.</p></details> |  |

| **[Streaming Operator Inference for Model Reduction of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12161v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction enables efficient simulation of complex dynamical systems by constructing low-dimensional surrogate models from high-dimensional data. The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.</p></details> |  |

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active inference and artificial reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21129v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate Trajectories Along Probability Flows: Pseudo Markovian Alternative to Mori Zwanzig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00015v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction techniques have emerged as a powerful paradigm across different fronts of scientific computing. Despite their success, the provided tools and methodologies remain limited if high-dimensional dynamical systems subject to initial uncertainty and/or stochastic noise are encountered; in particular if rare events are of interest. We address this open challenge by borrowing ideas from Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Chorin's optimal prediction method. The novelty of our work lies on employing time-dependent optimal projection of the dynamic on a desired set of resolved variables. We show several theoretical and numerical properties of our model reduction approach. In particular, we show that the devised surrogate trajectories are consistent with the probability flow of the full-order system. Furthermore, we identify the measure underlying the projection through polynomial chaos expansion technique. This allows us to efficiently compute the projection even for trajectories that are initiated on low probability events. Moreover, we investigate the introduced model-reduction error of the surrogate trajectories on a standard setup, characterizing the convergence behaviour of the scheme. Several numerical results highlight the computational advantages of the proposed scheme in comparison to Monte-Carlo and optimal prediction method. Through this framework, we demonstrate that by tracking the measure along with the consistent projection of the dynamic we are able to access accurate estimates of different statistics including observables conditional on a given initial configuration.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics, a data-driven nonlinear model reduction framework to build a low-dimensional surrogate model for complex evolution systems. Given time-dependent training data, we split the time domain into multiple overlapping windows, within which nonlinear dimension reduction is performed by auto-encoders to capture latent codes. Once a low-dimensional representation of the data is learned, a propagator network is trained to capture the evolution of the latent codes in each window, and a transcoder is trained to connect the latent codes between adjacent windows. The proposed windowed decomposition significantly simplifies propagator training by breaking long-horizon dynamics into multiple short, manageable segments, while the transcoders ensure consistency across windows. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we develop a mathematical theory establishing the representation power of WeldNet under the manifold hypothesis, justifying the success of nonlinear model reduction via deep autoencoder-based architectures. Our numerical experiments on various differential equations indicate that WeldNet can capture nonlinear latent structures and their underlying dynamics, outperforming both traditional projection-based approaches and recently developed nonlinear model reduction methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited hardware resources on today's mobile platforms hinder these applications, as they struggle to achieve real-time performance. In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices. Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\times$ speedup and 32.3\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional linear methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), provide structured and predictable behavior thanks to their linear formulation, but are limited in expressiveness. Nonlinear model reduction, typically implemented with neural networks, offers richer representations and higher compression; however, without structural constraints, the learned mappings often fail to generalize beyond the training distribution, leading to unstable or implausible deformations. We present a symmetric, convex-inspired neural formulation that bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear model reduction. Our approach adopts an input-convex neural network (ICNN) augmented with symmetry constraints to impose structure on the nonlinear decoder. This design retains the flexibility of neural mappings while embedding physical consistency, yielding coherent and stable displacements even under unseen conditions. We evaluate our method on challenging deformation scenarios involving forces of different magnitudes, inverse directions, and sparsely sampled training data. Our approach demonstrates superior generalization while maintaining compact reduced spaces, and supports real-time interactive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</p></details> | 28 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Dynamic Shape Control of Soft Robots Enabled by Data-Driven Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03931v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 8 Figures |

The Kempf-Ness theorem is used to establish that the $L^2$ regularizer is minimized on the balanced manifold. This allows us to decompose the training dynamics into two distinct gradient flows: a regularizing flow on fibers and a learning flow on the balanced manifold. We show that the regularizing flow is exactly solvable using the moment map. This approach provides a common mathematical framework for balancedness in deep learning and linear systems theory. We use this framework to interpret balancedness in terms of model reduction and Bayesian principles.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Filtered Neural Galerkin model reduction schemes for efficient propagation of initial condition uncertainties in digital twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00670v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification in digital twins is critical to enable reliable and credible predictions beyond available data. A key challenge is that ensemble-based approaches can become prohibitively expensive when embedded in control and data assimilation loops in digital twins, even when reduced models are used. We introduce a reduced modeling approach that advances in time the mean and covariance of the reduced solution distribution induced by the initial condition uncertainties, which eliminates the need to maintain and propagate a costly ensemble of reduced solutions. The mean and covariance dynamics are obtained as a moment closure from Neural Galerkin schemes on pre-trained neural networks, which can be interpreted as filtered Neural Galerkin dynamics analogous to Gaussian filtering and the extended Kalman filter. Numerical experiments demonstrate that filtered Neural Galerkin schemes achieve more than one order of magnitude speedup compared to ensemble-based uncertainty propagation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Interpretable Deep Learning and Analysis of Dynamical Systems via the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21852v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18636v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.</p></details> | 10 pages, BMVC2025 |

In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Framework for Symmetry Inference in Chaotic Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16509v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis, providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Flash Thinking via Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15374v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Since...</summary><p>Since the article needs improvement, it will be temporarily withdrawn</p></details> |

Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |

However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The "space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06608v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</p></details> | 62 pages, 26 figures |

From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 22 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.</p></details> |  |

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages of content, 33 with references; accepted version</p></details> |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |

Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

The inherent locomotion constraints of bipedal robots challenge their safe maneuvering capabilities in dynamic environments. When combined with the intricacies of social environments, including pedestrian interactions and social cues, such as emotions, these challenges become even more pronounced. To address these coupled problems, we propose a two-stage pipeline that considers both bipedal locomotion constraints and complex social environments. Specifically, social navigation scenarios are represented using sequential LiDAR grid maps (LGMs), from which we extract latent features, including collision regions, emotion-related discomfort zones, social interactions, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of evolving environments. The extracted features are directly mapped to the actions of reduced-order models (ROMs) through a DRL architecture. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates full-order dynamics and locomotion constraints during training, effectively accounting for tracking errors and restrictions of the locomotion controller while planning the trajectory with ROMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach exceeds both model-based planners and DRL-based baselines. The hardware videos and open-source code are available at https://gatech-lidar.github.io/emobipednav.github.io/.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Learning of Interpretable Reduced-Order Models for Jumping Quadruped Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06538v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models are central to motion planning and control of quadruped robots, yet existing templates are often hand-crafted for a specific locomotion modality. This motivates the need for automatic methods that extract task-specific, interpretable low-dimensional dynamics directly from data. We propose a methodology that combines a linear autoencoder with symbolic regression to derive such models. The linear autoencoder provides a consistent latent embedding for configurations, velocities, accelerations, and inputs, enabling the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to operate in a compact, physics-aligned space. A multi-phase, hybrid-aware training scheme ensures coherent latent coordinates across contact transitions. We focus our validation on quadruped jumping-a representative, challenging, yet contained scenario in which a principled template model is especially valuable. The resulting symbolic dynamics outperform the state-of-the-art handcrafted actuated spring-loaded inverted pendulum (aSLIP) baseline in simulation and hardware across multiple robots and jumping modalities.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We propose a training framework that couples a continuous-time form of operator inference with the adjoint-state method to obtain robust data-driven reduced-order models. This method minimizes a trajectory-based loss between reduced-order solutions and projected snapshot data, which removes the need to estimate time derivatives from noisy measurements and provides intrinsic temporal regularization through time integration. We derive the corresponding continuous adjoint equations to compute gradients efficiently and implement a gradient based optimizer to update the reduced model parameters. Each iteration only requires one forward reduced order solve and one adjoint solve, followed by inexpensive gradient assembly, making the method attractive for large-scale simulations. We validate the proposed method on three partial differential equations: viscous Burgers' equation, the two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation, and an advection-diffusion equation. We perform systematic comparisons against standard operator inference under two perturbation regimes, namely reduced temporal snapshot density and additive Gaussian noise. For clean data, both approaches deliver similar accuracy, but in situations with sparse sampling and noise, the proposed adjoint-based training provides better accuracy and enhanced roll-out stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparison of Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition Algorithms for Thermal-Hydraulics Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24205v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, algorithms aiming at learning models from available data have become quite popular due to two factors: 1) the significant developments in Artificial Intelligence techniques and 2) the availability of large amounts of data. Nevertheless, this topic has already been addressed by methodologies belonging to the Reduced Order Modelling framework, of which perhaps the most famous equation-free technique is Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This algorithm aims to learn the best linear model that represents the physical phenomena described by a time series dataset: its output is a best state operator of the underlying dynamical system that can be used, in principle, to advance the original dataset in time even beyond its span. However, in its standard formulation, this technique cannot deal with parametric time series, meaning that a different linear model has to be derived for each parameter realization. Research on this is ongoing, and some versions of a parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition already exist. This work contributes to this research field by comparing the different algorithms presently deployed and assessing their advantages and shortcomings compared to each other.

We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Policy Learning for Legged Robot with Simplified Model Pretraining and Model Homotopy Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24698v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating dynamic motions for legged robots remains a challenging problem. While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

| **[Active learning for data-driven reduced models of parametric differential systems with Bayesian operator inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00038v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work develops an active learning framework to intelligently enrich data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) of parametric dynamical systems, which can serve as the foundation of virtual assets in a digital twin. Data-driven ROMs are explainable, computationally efficient scientific machine learning models that aim to preserve the underlying physics of complex dynamical simulations. Since the quality of data-driven ROMs is sensitive to the quality of the limited training data, we seek to identify training parameters for which using the associated training data results in the best possible parametric ROM. Our approach uses the operator inference methodology, a regression-based strategy which can be tailored to particular parametric structure for a large class of problems. We establish a probabilistic version of parametric operator inference, casting the learning problem as a Bayesian linear regression. Prediction uncertainties stemming from the resulting probabilistic ROM solutions are used to design a sequential adaptive sampling scheme to select new training parameter vectors that promote ROM stability and accuracy globally in the parameter domain. We conduct numerical experiments for several nonlinear parametric systems of partial differential equations and compare the results to ROMs trained on random parameter samples. The results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive sampling strategy consistently yields more stable and accurate ROMs than random sampling does under the same computational budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[mLaSDI: Multi-stage latent space dynamics identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09207v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is essential across many scientific disciplines. However, high-fidelity solvers can be computationally prohibitive, motivating the development of reduced-order models (ROMs). Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was proposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the training data via an autoencoder and learns user-specified ordinary differential equations (ODEs), governing the latent dynamics, enabling rapid predictions for unseen parameters. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous problems, the autoencoder must simultaneously reconstruct the training data and satisfy the imposed latent dynamics, which are often competing objectives that limit accuracy, particularly for complex or high-frequency phenomena. To address this limitation, we propose multi-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, we train LaSDI sequentially in stages. After training the initial autoencoder, we train additional decoders which map the latent trajectories to residuals from previous stages. This staged residual learning, combined with periodic activation functions, enables recovery of high-frequency content without sacrificing interpretability of the latent dynamics. Numerical experiments on a multiscale oscillating system, unsteady wake flow, and the 1D-1V Vlasov equation demonstrate that mLaSDI achieves significantly lower reconstruction and prediction errors, often by an order of magnitude, while requiring less training time and reduced hyperparameter tuning compared to standard LaSDI.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reduced Order Modeling for Tsunami Forecasting with Bayesian Hierarchical Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19804v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552v7)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To explore the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and to probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of emulators of multiscale systems to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) the choice of an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. These insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific goals, processes, and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application by developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. Overall, these results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory providing a principled framework to guide model design and enhance causal understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Critical Assessment of Pattern Comparisons Between POD and Autoencoders in Intraventricular Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19376v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

It promises to drastically reduce expensive numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling. Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, SPIGM workshop at NeurIPS 2025, https://openreview.net/forum?id=IT9lF59UqG&noteId=IT9lF59UqG</p></details> |

Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.</p></details> |  |

Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.</p></details> | 38 pages, 14 figures |

In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Updating of constitutive parameters under hybrid uncertainties with a novel surrogate model applied to biofilms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15145v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of bacterial biofilm growth is essential for understanding their complex dynamics in biomedical, environmental, and industrial settings. These dynamics are shaped by a variety of environmental influences, including the presence of antibiotics, nutrient availability, and inter-species interactions, all of which affect species-specific growth rates. However, capturing this behavior in computational models is challenging due to the presence of hybrid uncertainties, a combination of epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete knowledge about model parameters) and aleatory uncertainty (reflecting inherent biological variability and stochastic environmental conditions). In this work, we present a Bayesian model updating (BMU) framework to calibrate a recently introduced multi-species biofilm growth model. To enable efficient inference in the presence of hybrid uncertainties, we construct a reduced-order model (ROM) derived using the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) approach. TSM allows for an efficient propagation of aleatory uncertainty, which enables single-loop Bayesian inference, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive nested (double-loop) schemes typically required in hybrid uncertainty quantification. The BMU framework employs a likelihood function constructed from the mean and variance of stochastic model outputs, enabling robust parameter calibration even under sparse and noisy data. We validate our approach through two case studies: a two-species and a four-species biofilm model. Both demonstrate that our method not only accurately recovers the underlying model parameters but also provides predictive responses consistent with the synthetic data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced Order Modeling of Energetic Materials Using Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks in a Latent Space (LatentPARC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12401v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Accuracy and Speed: A Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter with a Machine Learning Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12276v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, more and more machine learning (ML) surrogates are being developed for computationally expensive physical models. In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography.</p></details> |  |

These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.</p></details> |  |

However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.</p></details> |  |

While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by Applied Energy</p></details> |

This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (ML4PS). 12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Learning Stochastic Multiscale Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22655v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly from observational data. Drawing inspiration from physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, we resolve the macroscale state on a coarse mesh while introducing a microscale latent state to explicitly model unresolved dynamics. We learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a simulator-free amortized variational inference method with a Product of Experts likelihood that enforces scale separation. We present detailed numerical studies to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive accuracy compared to under-resolved direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at equivalent resolution, as well as reduced-order modeling approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</p></details> | 28 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v5)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Experiments were carried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under both irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under investigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses due to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven reduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring loads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of vessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware characterization of the model response by accounting for variability in hyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated that both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular and irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based ROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification, demonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea condition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in reproducing vessel dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, 1 box</p></details> |

Hug generates proposals that remain very close to hypersurfaces (level sets) of constant probabilty density. We analyse a generalization of Hug from hypersurfaces to manifolds of arbitrary dimensions, not necessarily arising in a sampling context. The analysis is based on interpreting, in a nonstandard way, Hug as a consistent discretization of a system of differential equations with a rather complicated structure. The proof of convergence of this discretization includes a number of unusual features we explore fully, in particular a supraconvergence property is established, whereby second order of convergence is attained with consistency of the first order. We uncover and discuss an unexpected property of the solutions of the underlying dynamical system that manifest itself by the existence of Hug trajectories that fail to cover the manifold of interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added some clarifications and additional numerical results</p></details> |

We estimate local patches of the covariance surface and then check whether the directional derivative in the $(1,1,0)$ direction is zero on each patch. The method only requires the covariance function to be locally smooth and does not assume stationarity in advance. It can be applied to general stochastic dynamical systems and provides a time-resolved view. We apply the test method to an SDOF system and to a stochastic Duffing oscillator. These examples show that the method is numerically stable and can detect departures from WSS in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite Expression Methods for Discovering Physical Laws from Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08342v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamics is a pervasive phenomenon observed in scientific and engineering disciplines. However, the task of deriving analytical expressions to describe nonlinear dynamics from limited data remains challenging. In this paper, we shall present a novel deep symbolic learning method called the "finite expression method" (FEX) to discover governing equations within a function space containing a finite set of analytic expressions, based on observed dynamic data. The key concept is to employ FEX to generate analytical expressions of the governing equations by learning the derivatives of partial differential equation (PDE) solutions through convolutions. Our numerical results demonstrate that our FEX surpasses other existing methods (such as PDE-Net, SINDy, GP, and SPL) in terms of numerical performance across a range of problems, including time-dependent PDE problems and nonlinear dynamical systems with time-varying coefficients. Moreover, the results highlight FEX's flexibility and expressive power in accurately approximating symbolic governing equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-Buchi Barrier Certificates for Discrete-time Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07695v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Barrier certificates provide functional overapproximations for the reachable set of dynamical systems and provide inductive guarantees on the safe evolution of the system. In automata-theoretic verification, a key query is to determine whether the system visits a given predicate over the states finitely often, typically resulting from the complement of the traditional Buchi acceptance condition. This paper proposes a barrier certificate approach to answer such queries by developing a notion of co-Buchi barrier certificates (CBBCs) that generalize classic barrier certificates to ensure that the traces of a system visit a given predicate a fixed number of times. Our notion of CBBC is inspired from bounded synthesis paradigm to LTL realizability, where the LTL specifications are converted to safety automata via universal co-Buchi automata with a bound on final state visitations provided as a hyperparameter. Our application of CBBCs in verification is analogous: we fix a bound and search for a suitable barrier certificate, increasing the bound if no suitable function can be found. We then use these CBBCs to verify our system against properties specified by co-Buchi automata and demonstrate their effectiveness via some case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stabilizing autoregressive forecasts in chaotic systems via multi-rate latent recurrence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14487v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon autoregressive forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems remains challenging due to rapid error amplification and distribution shift: small one-step inaccuracies compound into physically inconsistent rollouts and collapse of large-scale statistics. We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models: A Geometric Theory of Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10350v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast Coarse-graining and Equation Discovery with Foundation Inference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12618v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g., the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple, simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating consensus and dissent on massive discussion platforms with an $O(N)$ semantic-vector model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13932v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reaching consensus on massive discussion networks is critical for reducing noise and achieving optimal collective outcomes. However, the natural tendency of humans to preserve their initial ideas constrains the emergence of global solutions. To address this, Collective Intelligence (CI) platforms facilitate the discovery of globally superior solutions. We introduce a dynamical system based on the standard $O(N)$ model to drive the aggregation of semantically similar ideas. The system consists of users represented as nodes in a $d=2$ lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions, where their ideas are represented by semantic vectors computed with a pretrained embedding model. We analyze the system's equilibrium states as a function of the coupling parameter $β$. Our results show that $β> 0$ drives the system toward a ferromagnetic-like phase (global consensus), while $β< 0$ induces an antiferromagnetic-like state (maximum dissent), where users maximize semantic distance from their neighbors. This framework offers a controllable method for managing the tradeoff between cohesion and diversity in CI platforms.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GeoDynamics: A Geometric State-Space Neural Network for Understanding Brain Dynamics on Riemannian Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13570v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models (SSMs) have become a cornerstone for unraveling brain dynamics, revealing how latent neural states evolve over time and give rise to observed signals. By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

CausationEntropy is a Python package that implements oCSE and several of its significant optimizations and methodological extensions. In this paper, we introduce the version 1.1 release of CausationEntropy, which includes new synthetic data generators, plotting tools, and several advanced information-theoretical causal network discovery algorithms with criteria for estimating Gaussian, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), geometric k-nearest neighbors (geometric-kNN), kernel density (KDE) and Poisson entropic estimators. The package is easy to install from the PyPi software repository, is thoroughly documented, supplemented with extensive code examples, and is modularly structured to support future additions. The entire codebase is released under the MIT license and is available on GitHub and through PyPi Repository. We expect this package to serve as a benchmark tool for causal discovery in complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression emerged as a way to automate this task. This study presents an overview of the current literature on symbolic regression, while also comparing the efficiency of five state-of-the-art methods in recovering the governing equations from nine processes, including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models. Benchmark results demonstrate the PySR method as the most suitable for inferring equations, with some estimates being indistinguishable from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modeling real-world phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training instability in deep learning follows low-dimensional dynamical principles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13160v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning systems achieve remarkable empirical performance, yet the stability of the training process itself remains poorly understood. Training unfolds as a high-dimensional dynamical system in which small perturbations to optimization, data, parameters, or learning signals can induce abrupt and irreversible collapse, undermining reproducibility and scalability. We propose a unified dynamical perspective that characterizes training stability as an intrinsic property of learning systems, organized along four interacting dimensions: optimization, environmental/data, parametric, and learning-signal stability. We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms. Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate-based Bayesian calibration methods for chaotic systems: a comparison of traditional and non-traditional approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13071v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter calibration is essential for reducing uncertainty and improving predictive fidelity in physics-based models, yet it is often limited by the high computational cost of model evaluations. Bayesian calibration methods provide a principled framework for combining prior information with data while rigorously quantifying uncertainty. In this work, we compare four emulator-based Bayesian calibration strategies, Calibrate-Emulate-Sample (CES), History Matching (HM), Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED), and a goal-oriented extension of BOED (GBOED). The proposed GBOED formulation explicitly targets information gain with respect to the calibration posterior, aligning design decisions with downstream inference. We assess methods using accuracy and uncertainty quantification metrics, convergence behavior under increasing computational budgets, and practical considerations such as implementation complexity and robustness. For the Lorenz '96 system, CES, HM, and GBOED all yield strong calibration performance, even with limited numbers of model evaluations, while standard BOED generally underperforms in this setting. Differences among the strongest methods are modest, particularly as computational budgets increase. For the two-layer quasi-geostrophic system, all methods produce reasonable posterior estimates, and convergence behavior is more consistent. Overall, our results indicate that multiple emulator-based calibration strategies can perform comparably well when applied appropriately, with method selection often guided more by computational and practical considerations than by accuracy alone. These findings highlight both the limitations of standard BOED for calibration and the promise of goal-oriented and iterative approaches for efficient Bayesian inference in complex dynamical systems.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Sensing-Limited Control of Noiseless Linear Systems Under Nonlinear Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12782v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the fundamental information-theoretic limits for the control and sensing of noiseless linear dynamical systems subject to a broad class of nonlinear observations. We analyze the interactions between the control and sensing components by characterizing the minimum information flow required for stability. Specifically, we derive necessary conditions for mean-square observability and stabilizability, demonstrating that the average directed information rate from the state to the observations must exceed the intrinsic expansion rate of the unstable dynamics. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by non-Gaussian distributions inherent to nonlinear observation channels, we establish sufficient conditions by imposing regularity assumptions, specifically log-concavity, on the system's probabilistic components. We show that under these conditions, the divergence of differential entropy implies the convergence of the estimation error, thereby closing the gap between information-theoretic bounds and estimation performance. By establishing these results, we unveil the fundamental performance limits imposed by the sensing layer, extending classical data-rate constraints to the more challenging regime of nonlinear observation models.</p></details> | 5 pages, conference |
| **[An Adaptive Online Smoother with Closed-Form Solutions and Information-Theoretic Lag Selection for Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05870v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data assimilation (DA) combines partial observations with dynamical models to improve state estimation. Filter-based DA uses only past and present data and is the prerequisite for real-time forecasts. Smoother-based DA exploits both past and future observations. It aims to fill in missing data, provide more accurate estimations, and develop high-quality datasets. However, the standard smoothing procedure requires using all historical state estimations, which is storage-demanding, especially for high-dimensional systems. This paper develops an adaptive-lag online smoother for a large class of complex dynamical systems with strong nonlinear and non-Gaussian features, which has important applications to many real-world problems. The adaptive lag allows the utilization of observations only within a nearby window, thus reducing computational complexity and storage needs. Online lag adjustment is essential for tackling turbulent systems, where temporal autocorrelation varies significantly over time due to intermittency, extreme events, and nonlinearity. Based on the uncertainty reduction in the estimated state, an information criterion is developed to systematically determine the adaptive lag. Notably, the mathematical structure of these systems facilitates the use of closed analytic formulae to calculate the online smoother and adaptive lag, avoiding empirical tunings as in ensemble-based DA methods. The adaptive online smoother is applied to studying three important scientific problems. First, it helps detect online causal relationships between state variables. Second, the advantage of reduced computational storage expenditure is illustrated via Lagrangian DA, a high-dimensional nonlinear problem. Finally, the adaptive smoother advances online parameter estimation with partial observations, emphasizing the role of the observed extreme events in accelerating convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Lates...</summary><p>Latest revision. 46 pages (Main Text pp. 1--28; Appendix pp. 29--40), 9 figures (7 in Main Text, 2 in Appendix).

| **[Streaming Operator Inference for Model Reduction of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12161v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction enables efficient simulation of complex dynamical systems by constructing low-dimensional surrogate models from high-dimensional data. The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Parametric SVD of Koopman Operator for Stochastic Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07222v3)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-$k$ singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear-algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for NeurIPS 2025.

We propose the Flash STU architecture, a hybrid model that interleaves spectral state space model layers with sliding window attention, enabling scalability to billions of parameters for language modeling while maintaining a near-linear time complexity. We evaluate the Flash STU and its variants on diverse sequence prediction tasks, including linear dynamical systems, robotics control, and language modeling. We find that, given a fixed parameter budget, the Flash STU architecture consistently outperforms the Transformer and other leading state-space models such as S4 and Mamba-2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Networks for model order reduction of parameterized time-dependent PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11259v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

| **[Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition from Mode Extraction to Dimensional Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11116v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CR-DMD), a novel framework that robustifies the entire DMD process - from mode extraction to dimensional reduction - against mixed noise. Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes. Both stages are efficiently solved by a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets demonstrate that CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in terms of mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing.

| **[Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) and DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) recast sequential evaluation as a parallelizable optimization problem, sometimes yielding dramatic speedups. However, the factors governing the difficulty of these optimization problems remained unclear, limiting broader adoption. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between a system's dynamics and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization problem, as measured by its Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) constant. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior and quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. For predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in at worst $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length: a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis shows that predictable systems always yield well-conditioned optimization problems, whereas unpredictable systems lead to severe conditioning degradation. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized. We highlight predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '25. XG and LK dual lead authors.

At their core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis, provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs \emph{during training}, where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our approach, \textsc{CompreSSM}, applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units, but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity, with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher performance.

Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Barrier Certificates for Unknown Systems with Latent States and Polynomial Dynamics using Bayesian Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01807v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Certifying safety in dynamical systems is crucial, but barrier certificates - widely used to verify that system trajectories remain within a safe region - typically require explicit system models. When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. Probabilistic guarantees for its validity with respect to the true, unknown system are obtained by testing on an additional set of posterior samples. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |

However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

As a consequence, we obtain explicit barriers for algorithms solving algebraic telic problems coming from complex dynamical systems, such as those with positive topological entropy. For example, some telic problems cannot be decided by uniform arithmetic circuit families with only $+$ and $\times$ gates.</p></details> | 20 pages, 0 figures |
| **[A Control Theoretic Approach to Decentralized AI Economy Stabilization via Dynamic Buyback-and-Burn Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09961v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The democratization of artificial intelligence through decentralized networks represents a paradigm shift in computational provisioning, yet the long-term viability of these ecosystems is critically endangered by the extreme volatility of their native economic layers. Current tokenomic models, which predominantly rely on static or threshold-based buyback heuristics, are ill-equipped to handle complex system dynamics and often function pro-cyclically, exacerbating instability during market downturns. To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic-Control Buyback Mechanism (DCBM), a formalized control-theoretic framework that utilizes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with strict solvency constraints to regulate the token economy as a dynamical system. Extensive agent-based simulations utilizing Jump-Diffusion processes demonstrate that DCBM fundamentally outperforms static baselines, reducing token price volatility by approximately 66% and lowering operator churn from 19.5% to 8.1% in high-volatility regimes. These findings establish that converting tokenomics from static rules into continuous, structurally constrained control loops is a necessary condition for secure and sustainable decentralized intelligence networks.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, rigorously quantifying how well a PINN captures the complete dynamical behavior of the system, beyond simple trajectory prediction, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel experimental framework to address this by employing Fisher information for differentiable dynamical systems, denoted $g_F^C$. This Fisher information, distinct from its statistical counterpart, measures inherent uncertainties in deterministic systems, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, and is related to the phase space curvature and the net stretching action of the state space evolution. We hypothesize that if a PINN accurately learns the underlying dynamics of a physical system, then the Fisher information landscape derived from the PINN's learned equations of motion will closely match that of the original analytical model. This match would signify that the PINN has achieved comprehensive fidelity capturing not only the state evolution but also crucial geometric and stability properties. We outline an experimental methodology using the dynamical model of a car to compute and compare $g_F^C$ for both the analytical model and a trained PINN. The comparison, based on the Jacobians of the respective system dynamics, provides a quantitative measure of the PINN's fidelity in representing the system's intricate dynamical characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted and is currently under review at IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

However, most existing methods rely on deep learning techniques that are highly dependent on large-scale datasets for training, which are difficult and expensive to acquire in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method based on self-organizing network for 3D anomaly ranking, also named 3D-SONAR. The core idea is to model the 3D point cloud as a dynamic system, where the points are represented as an undirected graph and interact via attractive and repulsive forces. The energy distribution induced by these forces can reveal surface anomalies. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior anomaly detection performance in both open surface and closed surface without training. This work provides a new perspective on unsupervised inspection and highlights the potential of physics-inspired models in industrial anomaly detection tasks with limited data.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Tipping Point Forecasting in Non-Stationary Dynamics on Function Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08794v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tipping points are abrupt, drastic, and often irreversible changes in the evolution of non-stationary and chaotic dynamical systems. For instance, increased greenhouse gas concentrations are predicted to lead to drastic decreases in low cloud cover, referred to as a climatological tipping point. In this paper, we learn the evolution of such non-stationary dynamical systems using a novel recurrent neural operator (RNO), which learns mappings between function spaces. After training RNO on only the pre-tipping dynamics, we employ it to detect future tipping points using an uncertainty-based approach. In particular, we propose a conformal prediction framework to forecast tipping points by monitoring deviations from physics constraints (such as conserved quantities and partial differential equations), enabling forecasting of these abrupt changes along with a rigorous measure of uncertainty. We illustrate our proposed methodology on non-stationary ordinary and partial differential equations, such as the Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. We also apply our methods to forecast a climate tipping point in stratocumulus cloud cover and airfoil wake and stall transitions using only limited knowledge of the governing equations. For the latter, we show that our proposed method zero-shot generalizes to forecasting multiple future tipping points under varying Reynolds numbers. In our experiments, we demonstrate that even partial or approximate physics constraints can be used to accurately forecast future tipping points.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Agentic Leash: Extracting Causal Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00097v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.</p></details> | 15 figures |

We associate families of decision problems, called telic problems, to dynamical systems of a certain class. These decision problems formalize finite-time reachability questions for the dynamics with respect to natural coarse-grainings of state space. Our main result shows that complexity-theoretic lower bounds have dynamical consequences: if a system admits a telic problem for which every decider runs in time $2^{Ω(n)}$, then it must have positive topological entropy. This result and others lead to methods for classifying dynamical systems through proving bounds on the runtime of algorithms solving their associated telic problems, or by constructing polynomial-time reductions between telic problems coming from distinct dynamical systems.</p></details> | 25 pages, 1 figure |

However, standard BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to one-step self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step-sizes or multi-step self-consistency losses. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is based on the incremental construction of a 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG). We integrate expectations from two sources: contextual priors from past observations and semantic knowledge from external graphs like ConceptNet. These are embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to create an expectation-biased inference process. This method moves beyond static, frame-by-frame analysis to enhance the robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time.

However, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for repeated queries and large-scale 3D scenarios. Recent purely data-driven networks improve efficiency, yet they often bypass this scattering mechanism, which may compromise physical consistency and generalization. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose U-PINet, a fully end-to-end, physics-informed hierarchical network for efficient RCS prediction via 3D electromagnetic scattering reconstruction. Once the scattering quantities are reconstructed, scattered fields and RCS can be evaluated for arbitrary observation directions via the radiation integral. U-PINet explicitly learns physics-consistent intermediate scattering representations by modeling local electromagnetic coupling and long-range radiation effects through a hierarchical operator design inspired by near-far field decomposition in fast solvers. A physics-guided graph neural network is incorporated to capture self- and mutual-coupling among mesh elements of complex targets, enabling physically interpretable intermediate representations. By embedding governing equations as residual constraints, U-PINet enables accurate object reconstruction of scattering quantities and consequently reliable RCS prediction across observation directions, while significantly reducing runtime. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that U-PINet achieves EM-solver-level RCS accuracy and 3D object reconstruction with orders-of-magnitude speedups, and generalizes well to unseen geometries under limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to an Elsevier Journal</p></details> |

Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</p></details> | 29p, 22 figures |

Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WWW 2026, 12pages</p></details> |

Classical heuristics struggle with workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) risks overheating. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, a graph neural network surrogate achieving deep learning accuracy at heuristic speeds (2-7ms). GraphPerf-RT is, to our knowledge, the first to unify task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Evidential regression with Normal-Inverse-Gamma priors provides calibrated uncertainty; we validate on makespan prediction for risk-aware scheduling. Experiments on three ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Orin NX, RUBIK Pi) achieve R^2 = 0.81 on log-transformed makespan with Spearman rho = 0.95 and conservative uncertainty calibration (PICP = 99.9% at 95% confidence). Integration with four RL methods demonstrates that multi-agent model-based RL with GraphPerf-RT as the world model achieves 66% makespan reduction and 82% energy reduction versus model-free baselines, with zero thermal violations.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 4 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by WWW-2026</p></details> |

We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories. We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data. Importantly, AFG can be used to extract granular explanations needed to increase transparency for malware detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed AFG and Meta-Coarsening approach can provide both increased explainability and inference performance at certain coarsening levels. However, most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider granular explainability in malware detection using GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02600v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces, struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training, we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover, the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26), Main Technical Track</p></details> |
| **[Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14115v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Liquid Time-Constant networks (LTCs), a type of continuous-time graph neural network, excel at modeling irregularly-sampled dynamics but are fundamentally confined to Euclidean space. This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

| **[Focus on What Matters: Fisher-Guided Adaptive Multimodal Fusion for Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02438v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerability detection can be formulated as a binary classification problem that determines whether a given code snippet contains security defects. Existing multimodal methods typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations extracted by pretrained models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations extracted by graph neural networks, under the implicit assumption that introducing an additional modality necessarily yields information gain. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate the limitations of this assumption: pretrained models already encode substantial structural information implicitly, leading to strong overlap between the two modalities; moreover, graph encoders are generally less effective than pretrained language models in feature extraction. As a result, naive fusion not only struggles to obtain complementary signals but can also dilute effective discriminative cues due to noise propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-conditioned complementary fusion strategy that uses Fisher information to quantify task relevance, transforming cross-modal interaction from full-spectrum matching into selective fusion within a task-sensitive subspace. Our theoretical analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, this strategy significantly tightens the upper bound on the output error. Based on this insight, we design the TaCCS-DFA framework, which combines online low-rank Fisher subspace estimation with an adaptive gating mechanism to enable efficient task-oriented fusion. Experiments on the BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal benchmarks demonstrate that TaCCS-DFA delivers up to a 6.3-point gain in F1 score with only a 3.4% increase in inference latency, while maintaining low calibration error.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient Routing: Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing in Smart Logistics via Spatiotemporal Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13632v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of the e-commerce industry, the logistics network is experiencing unprecedented pressure. The traditional static routing strategy most time cannot tolerate the traffic congestion and fluctuating retail demand. In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%. This empirical evidence confirms that the proposed data-driven approach can effectively balance delivery efficiency and operational safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks are Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13465v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that a single training trajectory can transform a graph neural network into an unsupervised heuristic for combinatorial optimization. Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrustEnergy: A Unified Framework for Accurate and Reliable User-level Energy Usage Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13422v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy usage prediction is important for various real-world applications, including grid management, infrastructure planning, and disaster response. Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

In such networks, multiple AI agents optimize the network to achieve distinct and often competing objectives. As such, conflicts become inevitable and have the potential to degrade performance, cause instability, and disrupt service. Current approaches for conflict detection rely on conflict graphs created based on relationships between AI agents, parameters, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Existing works often rely on complex and computationally expensive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and depend on manually chosen thresholds to create conflict graphs. In this work, we present the first systematic framework for conflict detection in AI-native mobile networks, propose a two-tower encoder architecture for learning interactions based on data from the RAN, and introduce a data-driven sparsity-based mechanism for autonomously reconstructing conflict graphs without manual fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL, with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score. Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces two major challenges: (1) demographic-based targeting creates segment-specific LTV distributions with large value variations across user groups; and (2) dynamic marketing strategies generate irregular behavioral sequences where engagement patterns evolve rapidly. We propose a Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HT-GNN), which jointly models demographic heterogeneity and temporal dynamics through three key components: (i) a hypergraph-supervised module capturing inter-segment relationships; (ii) a transformer-based temporal encoder with adaptive weighting; and (iii) a task-adaptive mixture-of-experts with dynamic prediction towers for multi-horizon LTV forecasting. Experiments on \textit{Baidu Ads} with 15 million users demonstrate that HT-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics and prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Code Analysis via Graph-Guided Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12890v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious behavior is often hidden in small, easily overlooked code fragments, especially within large and complex codebases. The cross-file dependencies of these fragments make it difficult for even powerful large language models (LLMs) to detect them reliably. We propose a graph-centric attention acquisition pipeline that enhances LLMs' ability to localize malicious behavior. The approach parses a project into a code graph, uses an LLM to encode nodes with semantic and structural signals, and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under sparse supervision. The GNN performs an initial detection, and through backtracking of its predictions, identifies key code sections that are most likely to contain malicious behavior. These influential regions are then used to guide the LLM's attention for in-depth analysis. This strategy significantly reduces interference from irrelevant context while maintaining low annotation costs. Extensive experiments show that the method consistently outperforms existing methods on multiple public and self-built datasets, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in software security scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Sparse Circuit Extraction from Billion-Parameter Language Models through Scalable Attribution Graph Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12879v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanistic interpretability seeks to reverse-engineer neural network computations into human-understandable algorithms, yet extracting sparse computational circuits from billion-parameter language models remains challenging due to exponential search complexity and pervasive polysemanticity. The proposed Hierarchical Attribution Graph Decomposition (HAGD) framework reduces circuit discovery complexity from O(2^n) exhaustive enumeration to O(n^2 log n) through multi-resolution abstraction hierarchies and differentiable circuit search. The methodology integrates cross-layer transcoders for monosemantic feature extraction, graph neural network meta-learning for topology prediction, and causal intervention protocols for validation. Empirical evaluation spans GPT-2 variants, Llama-7B through Llama-70B, and Pythia suite models across algorithmic tasks and natural language benchmarks. On modular arithmetic tasks, the framework achieves up to 91% behavioral preservation ($\pm$2.3\% across runs) while maintaining interpretable subgraph sizes. Cross-architecture transfer experiments suggest that discovered circuits exhibit moderate structural similarity (averaging 67%) across model families, indicating potential shared computational patterns. These results provide preliminary foundations for interpretability at larger model scales while identifying significant limitations in current attribution methodologies that require future advances.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gyuye...</summary><p>Gyuyeon Na, Minjung Park, Soyoun Kim contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

The accurate representation of ocean dynamics across a wide range of spatial scales remains a major challenge in such applications. This study proposes a multi-scale graph neural network-based ocean model for 10-day global forecasting that improves short-term prediction skill and enhances the representation of multi-scale ocean variability. The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics. In addition, the model incorporates surface atmospheric variables along with ocean state variables as node inputs to improve short-term prediction accuracy by representing atmospheric forcing. Evaluation using surface kinetic energy spectra and case studies shows that the model accurately represents a broad range of spatial scales, while root mean square error comparisons demonstrate improved skill in short-term predictions. These results indicate that the proposed model delivers more accurate short-term forecasts and improved representation of multi-scale ocean dynamics, thereby highlighting its potential to advance data-driven, eddy-resolving global ocean forecasting.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the notion of \textit{Subpopulation Boolean Isomorphism} (SBI) as an invariant that strictly subsumes existing expressivity measures such as Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL), biconnectivity-based, and homomorphism-based frameworks. Our theoretical results identify Fourier degree, circuit class (AC$^0$, NC$^1$), and influence as key barriers to expressivity in fairness-aware GNNs. We design a circuit-traversal-based fairness algorithm capable of handling subpopulations defined by high-complexity Boolean functions, such as parity, which break existing baselines. Experiments on real-world graphs show that our method achieves low fairness gaps across intersectional groups where state-of-the-art methods fail, providing the first principled treatment of GNN expressivity tailored to fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</p></details> |  |

Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.</p></details> |  |

Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.</p></details> |  |

Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks. These results highlight topology-aware multiscale routing as an effective principle for 3D molecular graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATLAS: Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14908v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[RIPPLE++: An Incremental Framework for Efficient GNN Inference on Evolving Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12347v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graphs are dynamic, with frequent updates to their structure and features due to evolving vertex and edge properties. These continual changes pose significant challenges for efficient inference in graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing vertex-wise and layer-wise inference approaches are ill-suited for dynamic graphs, as they incur redundant computations, large neighborhood traversals, and high communication costs, especially in distributed settings. Additionally, while sampling-based approaches can be adopted to approximate final layer embeddings, these are often not preferred in critical applications due to their non-determinism. These limitations hinder low-latency inference required in real-time applications. To address this, we propose RIPPLE++, a framework for streaming GNN inference that efficiently and accurately updates embeddings in response to changes in the graph structure or features. RIPPLE++ introduces a generalized incremental programming model that captures the semantics of GNN aggregation functions and incrementally propagates updates to affected neighborhoods. RIPPLE++ accommodates all common graph updates, including vertex/edge addition/deletions and vertex feature updates. RIPPLE++ supports both single-machine and distributed deployments. On a single machine, it achieves up to $56$K updates/sec on sparse graphs like Arxiv ($169$K vertices, $1.2$M edges), and about $7.6$K updates/sec on denser graphs like Products ($2.5$M vertices, $123.7$M edges), with latencies of $0.06$--$960$ms, and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by $2.2$--$24\times$ on throughput. In distributed settings, RIPPLE++ offers up to $\approx25\times$ higher throughput and $20\times$ lower communication costs compared to recomputing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended full-length version of paper that appeared at ICDCS 2025: "RIPPLE: Scalable Incremental GNN Inferencing on Large Streaming Graphs", Pranjal Naman and Yogesh Simmhan, in International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), 2025.

| **[GNN2R: Weakly-Supervised Rationale-Providing Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02317v4)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), knowledge graph-based question answering (KGQA) remains essential for producing verifiable and hallucination-resistant answers in many real-world settings where answer trustworthiness and computational efficiency are highly valued. However, most existing KGQA methods provide only final answers in the form of KG entities. Without explicit explanations -- ideally in the form of intermediate reasoning process over relevant KG triples, the QA results are difficult to inspect and interpret. Moreover, this limitation prevents the rich and verifiable knowledge encoded in KGs, which is a key advantage of KGQA over LLMs, from being fully leveraged. However, addressing this issue remains highly challenging due to the lack of annotated intermediate reasoning process and the requirement of high efficiency in KGQA. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network-based Two-Step Reasoning method (GNN2R) that can efficiently retrieve both final answers and corresponding reasoning subgraphs as verifiable rationales, using only weak supervision from widely-available final answer annotations. We extensively evaluated GNN2R and demonstrated that GNN2R substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art KGQA methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and the quality of generated explanations. The complete code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ruijie-wang-uzh/GNN2R.</p></details> |  |

As AD and FTD propagate along white-matter regions in a global, graph-dependent manner, graph-based neural networks are well suited to capture these patterns. Hence, we introduce ARMARecon, a unified graph learning framework that integrates Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) graph filtering with a reconstruction-driven objective to enhance feature representation and improve classification accuracy. ARMARecon effectively models both local and global connectivity by leveraging 20-bin Fractional Anisotropy (FA) histogram features extracted from white-matter regions, while mitigating over-smoothing. Overall, ARMARecon achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the multi-site dMRI datasets ADNI and NIFD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Effective and Unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution via RAG and Structural Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12035v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing scale of social media, social event detection and evolution modeling have attracted increasing attention. Graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become mainstream approaches in this area. However, existing methods still face three major challenges. First, the sheer volume of social media messages makes learning resource-intensive. Second, the fragmentation of social media messages often impedes the model's ability to capture a comprehensive view of the events. Third, the lack of structured temporal context has hindered the development of effective models for event evolution, limiting users' access to event information. To address these challenges, we propose a foundation model for unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution, namely RagSEDE. Specifically, RagSEDE introduces a representativeness- and diversity-driven sampling strategy to extract key messages from massive social streams, significantly reducing noise and computational overhead. It further establishes a novel paradigm based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that enhances PLMs in detecting events while simultaneously constructing and maintaining an evolving event knowledge base. Finally, RagSEDE leverages structural information theory to dynamically model event evolution keywords for the first time. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of RagSEDE in open-world social event detection and evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for The Web Conference (WWW) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Automating Traffic Monitoring with SHM Sensor Networks via Vision-Supervised Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19023v3)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Graph Neural Networks with Anatomical Priors for Explainable Chest X-ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11987v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a structural graph reasoning framework that incorporates explicit anatomical priors for explainable vision-based diagnosis. Convolutional feature maps are reinterpreted as patch-level graphs, where nodes encode both appearance and spatial coordinates, and edges reflect local structural adjacency. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that rely on generic message passing, we introduce a custom structural propagation mechanism that explicitly models relative spatial relations as part of the reasoning process. This design enables the graph to act as an inductive bias for structured inference rather than a passive relational representation. The proposed model jointly supports node-level lesion-aware predictions and graph-level diagnostic reasoning, yielding intrinsic explainability through learned node importance scores without relying on post-hoc visualization techniques. We demonstrate the approach through a chest X-ray case study, illustrating how structural priors guide relational reasoning and improve interpretability. While evaluated in a medical imaging context, the framework is domain-agnostic and aligns with the broader vision of graph-based reasoning across artificial intelligence systems. This work contributes to the growing body of research exploring graphs as computational substrates for structure-aware and explainable learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. In addition, we propose a new approach of obtaining an unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem. Experimental results with real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. Further, if we jointly finetune the base embedding fed into GRACE as input together with the rest of the GNN component of GRACE, there is a remarkable boost of 15.8% in performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Method for Detecting Spatio-temporal Correlation Anomalies of WSN Nodes Based on Topological Information Enhancement and Time-frequency Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11951v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing anomaly detection methods for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) generally suffer from insufficient ex-traction of spatio-temporal correlation features, reliance on either time-domain or frequency-domain information alone, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a topology-enhanced spatio-temporal feature fusion anomaly detection method, TE-MSTAD. First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance. Testing on both public and real-world datasets demonstrates that the TE-MSTAD model achieves F1 scores of 92.52% and 93.28%, respectively, exhibiting superior detection performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We integrate EAGLE-I outage records from 2014 to 2024 with weather, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

| **[GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Adaptive Mechanism for Large Neighborhood Search using Dual Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11414v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factored Value Functions for Graph-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11401v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Networks for model order reduction of parameterized time-dependent PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11259v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

| **[Theoretically and Practically Efficient Resistance Distance Computation on Large Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11159v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\% in F1 and 39.14\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.</p></details> |  |

We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Graph Linear Transformations, a linear transformation that realizes direct and indirect feature mixing on graphs through a single, well-defined linear operator derived from the graph structure. By interpreting graphs as walk-summable Gaussian graphical models, we compute these transformations via Gaussian Belief Propagation, enabling each node to aggregate information from both direct and indirect neighbors without explicit enumeration of multi-hop paths. We show that different constructions of the underlying precision matrix induce distinct and interpretable propagation biases, ranging from selective edge-level interactions to uniform structural smoothing, and that Graph Linear Transformations can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to both local message-passing GNNs and dynamic neighborhood aggregation models across homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 Figures |

We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features, directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics. Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLGC: Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10358v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.</p></details> |  |

Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.</p></details> |  |

In order to further improve the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model achieves better results than other neural network methods.</p></details> |  |

To assess whether agents can navigate efficiently within such unprecedented topologies, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning (RL), supervised learning, and graph neural networks (GNNs). The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across multiple vertical levels and varying density scenarios, using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Experiments show that the full AI-integrated architecture enables agents to achieve an average commute time of 7.8--8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89\%, and a reachability index over 91\%, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies indicate that removing intelligent modules such as RL or GNN significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85\% and reachability falling below 70\%. Environmental modeling demonstrates low energy consumption and minimal CO$_2$ emissions when electric modes are prioritized. These results suggest that efficient and sustainable mobility in extreme urban forms is achievable, provided adaptive AI systems, intelligent infrastructure, and real-time feedback mechanisms are implemented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Surrogates to leverage Mechanistic Expert Knowledge towards Reliable and Immediate Pandemic Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06500v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of an age-structured and spatially resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulation model. This combined approach complements classical modeling approaches which are mostly mechanistic and purely data-driven machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a spatial graph with 400 nodes representing German counties. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across horizons of 30-90 day simulation and prediction, allowing up to three contact change points, the surrogate model attains 10-27 \% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration. These results show how GNN surrogates can translate complex metapopulation models into immediate, reliable tools for pandemic response.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic Topic Modeling for Strategic Multiagent Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10501v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly GNN, DRL, and PTM methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) ML methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of GNN. Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of RL, and in particular that of multiagent deep reinforcement learning. Single-agent deep RL has been widely used for decision making in demanding game settings. Its application in multiagent settings though is hindered due to, e.g., varying relationships between agents, and non-stationarity of the environment. We describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts, and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes probabilistic topic modeling (PTM) in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. Finally, we identify certain open challenges -- specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[SGAC: A Graph Neural Network Framework for Imbalanced and Structure-Aware AMP Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16276v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifying Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) from the vast collection of peptides derived from metagenomic sequencing offers a promising avenue for combating antibiotic resistance. However, most existing AMP classification methods rely primarily on sequence-based representations and fail to capture the spatial structural information critical for accurate identification. Although recent graph-based approaches attempt to incorporate structural information, they typically construct residue- or atom-level graphs that introduce redundant atomic details and increase structural complexity. Furthermore, the class imbalance between the small number of known AMPs and the abundant non-AMPs significantly hinders predictive performance. To address these challenges, we employ lightweight OmegaFold to predict the three-dimensional structures of peptides and construct peptide graphs using C α atoms to capture their backbone geometry and spatial topology. Building on this representation, we propose the Spatial GNN-based AMP Classifier (SGAC), a novel framework that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract structural features and generate discriminative graph representations. To handle class imbalance, SGAC incorporates Weight-enhanced Contrastive Learning to cluster structurally similar peptides and separate dissimilar ones through adaptive weighting, and applies Weight-enhanced Pseudo-label Distillation to generate high-confidence pseudo labels for unlabeled samples, achieving balanced and consistent representation learning. Experiments on publicly available AMP and non-AMP datasets demonstrate that SGAC significantly achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT-Face: Forensic Face Identification using Attention Guided Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09229v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person identification in forensic investigations becomes very challenging when common identification means for DNA (i.e., hair strands, soft tissue) are not available. Current methods utilize deep learning methods for face recognition. However, these methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between two different forensic modalities. In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\_Mandi\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables (ICPR_2026)</p></details> |

To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce GPA(graph neural network (GNN)-based Path-Aware multi-view circuit learning), a novel GNN framework that learns precise, data-driven delay predictions by synergistically fusing three complementary views of circuit structure: And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs)-based functional encoding, post-mapping technology emphasizes critical timing paths. Trained exclusively on real cell delays extracted from critical paths of industrial-grade post-mapping netlists, GPA learns to classify cut delays with unprecedented accuracy, directly informing smarter mapping decisions. Evaluated on the 19 EPFL combinational benchmarks, GPA achieves 19.9%, 2.1% and 4.1% average delay reduction over the conventional heuristics methods (techmap, MCH) and the prior state-of-the-art ML-based approach SLAP, respectively-without compromising area efficiency.</p></details> | 7pages, 4figures |

We introduce a unified benchmarking framework that decouples PEs from architectural choices, enabling a fair comparison across 8 GNN and Transformer models, 9 PEs, and 10 synthetic and real-world datasets. Across more than 500 model-PE-dataset configurations, we find that commonly used expressiveness proxies, including Weisfeiler-Lehman distinguishability, do not reliably predict downstream performance. In particular, highly expressive PEs frequently fail to improve, and can even degrade performance on real-world tasks. At the same time, we identify several simple and previously overlooked model-PE combinations that match or outperform recent state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the strong task-dependence of PEs and underscore the need for empirical validation beyond theoretical expressiveness. To support reproducible research, we release an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating PEs for graph learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD 2026 Datasets & Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[A Mesh-Adaptive Hypergraph Neural Network for Unsteady Flow Around Oscillating and Rotating Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22252v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks, recently introduced into the field of fluid flow surrogate modeling, have been successfully applied to model the temporal evolution of various fluid flow systems. Existing applications, however, are mostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work extends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow around structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we propose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate model with part of the mesh/graph co-rotating with the structure and part of the mesh/graph static. A single layer of interface cells are constructed at the interface between the two parts and are allowed to distort and adapt, which helps in circumventing the difficulty of interpolating information encoded by the neural network at every graph neural network layer. Dedicated reconstruction and re-projection schemes are designed to counter the error caused by the distortion and connectivity change of the interface cells. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow around a 2D oscillating airfoil, and (ii) fluid flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model achieves stable rollout predictions over hundreds or even a thousand time steps. We further demonstrate that one could enforce accurate, error-bounded prediction results by incorporating the measurements from sparse pressure sensors. In addition to the accurate flow field predictions, the lift and drag force predictions closely match with the computational fluid dynamics calculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling fluid flow around rotating structures, and paving the path towards a graph neural network-based surrogate model for more complex scenarios like flow around marine propellers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Subgraph GNNs for Node Classification:an Overlooked Potential Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06614v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the strong performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in node classification. However, most existing GNNs adopt a node-centric perspective and rely on global message passing, leading to high computational and memory costs that hinder scalability. To mitigate these challenges, subgraph-based methods have been introduced, leveraging local subgraphs as approximations of full computational trees. While this approach improves efficiency, it often suffers from performance degradation due to the loss of global contextual information, limiting its effectiveness compared to global GNNs. To address this trade-off between scalability and classification accuracy, we reformulate the node classification task as a subgraph classification problem and propose SubGND (Subgraph GNN for NoDe). This framework introduces a differentiated zero-padding strategy and an Ego-Alter subgraph representation method to resolve label conflicts while incorporating an Adaptive Feature Scaling Mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions based on dataset-specific dependencies. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SubGND achieves performance comparable to or surpassing global message-passing GNNs, particularly in heterophilic settings, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability as a promising solution for node classification.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Directed Homophily-Aware Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22362v3)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in various learning tasks on graph-structured data. Nevertheless, most GNNs struggle to generalize to heterophilic neighborhoods. Additionally, many GNNs ignore the directional nature of real-world graphs, resulting in suboptimal performance on directed graphs with asymmetric structures. In this work, we propose Directed Homophily-aware Graph Neural Network (DHGNN), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by incorporating homophily-aware and direction-sensitive components. DHGNN employs a resettable gating mechanism to adaptively modulate message contributions based on homophily levels and informativeness, and a structure-aware noise-tolerant fusion module to effectively integrate node representations from the original and reverse directions. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic directed graph datasets demonstrate that DHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification and link prediction. In particular, DHGNN improves over the best baseline by up to 15.07\% in link prediction. Our analysis further shows that the gating mechanism captures directional homophily gaps and fluctuating homophily across layers, providing deeper insights into message-passing behavior on complex graph structures.</p></details> |  |

Diagnostic complexity arises from visual symptom overlap with conditions like age-related macular degeneration and hypertensive retinopathy, exacerbated by high misdiagnosis rates in underserved regions. This study introduces TIMM-ProRS, a novel deep learning framework integrating Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Graph Neural Network (GNN) with multi-modal fusion. TIMM-ProRS uniquely leverages both retinal images and temporal biomarkers (HbA1c, retinal thickness) to capture multi-modal and temporal dynamics. Evaluated comprehensively across diverse datasets including APTOS 2019 (trained), Messidor-2, RFMiD, EyePACS, and Messidor-1 (validated), the model achieves 97.8\% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.96, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing methods like RSG-Net and DeepDR. This approach enables early, precise, and interpretable diagnosis, supporting scalable telemedical management and enhancing global eye health sustainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[GADPN: Graph Adaptive Denoising and Perturbation Networks via Singular Value Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08230v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on graph-structured data, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the observed graph, which often contains noise, missing links, or structural properties misaligned with GNNs' underlying assumptions. To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating its ability to robustly learn enhanced graph structures across diverse network types.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfGraND: An Influence-Guided GNN-to-MLP Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08033v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the go-to model for graph data analysis. However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: "How important is a node to the structure of the graph?" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2026</p></details> |

Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of discarding fundamental graph structures, thus reducing interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure-aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and its structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods (i) achieve top performance compared to alternative pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii) preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025.

However, many Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) approaches for this prediction are constrained by their choice of molecular representation: handcrafted descriptors capture global properties but miss local topology, graph neural networks encode structure but often lack broader chemical context, and SMILES-based language models provide contextual patterns learned from large corpora but are seldom combined with structural features. To exploit these complementary signals, we introduce Rep3Net, a unified multimodal architecture that fuses RDKit molecular descriptors, graph-derived features from a residual graph-convolutional backbone, and ChemBERTa SMILES embeddings. We evaluate Rep3Net on a curated ChEMBL subset for Human PARP1 using fivefold cross validation. Rep3Net attains an MSE of $0.83\pm0.06$, RMSE of $0.91\pm0.03$, $R^{2}=0.43\pm0.01$, and yields Pearson and Spearman correlations of $0.66\pm0.01$ and $0.67\pm0.01$, respectively, substantially improving over several strong GNN baselines. In addition, Rep3Net achieves a favorable latency-to-parameter trade-off thanks to a single-layer GCN backbone and parallel frozen encoders. Ablations show that graph topology, ChemBERTa semantics, and handcrafted descriptors each contribute complementary information, with full fusion providing the largest error reduction. These results demonstrate that multimodal representation fusion can improve potency prediction for PARP1 and provide a scalable framework for virtual screening in early-stage drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</p></details> |  |

We challenge this prevailing focus in GNN research, arguing that these phenomena are less critical for practical applications than assumed. We suggest that performance decreases often stem from uninformative receptive fields rather than over-smoothing. We support this position with extensive experiments on several standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating that accuracy and over-smoothing are mostly uncorrelated and that optimal model depths remain small even with mitigation techniques, thus highlighting the negligible role of over-smoothing. Similarly, we challenge that over-squashing is always detrimental in practical applications. Instead, we posit that the distribution of relevant information over the graph frequently factorises and is often localised within a small k-hop neighbourhood, questioning the necessity of jointly observing entire receptive fields or engaging in an extensive search for long-range interactions. The results of our experiments show that architectural interventions designed to mitigate over-squashing fail to yield significant performance gains. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in theoretical research, urging a diligent analysis of learning tasks and datasets using statistics that measure the underlying distribution of label-relevant information to better understand their localisation and factorisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset. Given its efficiency and accuracy, PLANET v2.0 can hopefully become one of the practical tools for virtual screening workflows.

On the PubMed citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN, 7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM), training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary features. Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2), outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6% lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns. This work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph classification tasks. To promote the research community, we release our project at https://github.com/s010m00n/GASEM4NC.</p></details> | <details><summary>It's ...</summary><p>It's written so poorly, my bad</p></details> |

We study reliability through the lens of multi-model consensus: given responses from several heterogeneous LLMs, can we learn which answer is most likely correct for a given query? We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource-constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hallucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing complementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup.</p></details> |  |

This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features. Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods, including those using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal dependencies, show strong potential but need large amounts of labeled data, which limits their practical use. Label-efficient alternatives like graph-based non-contrastive learning offer a potential solution, as they can learn useful representations from unlabeled data without using negative samples. However, current graph non-contrastive approaches are built for single-view graph representations and cannot be directly used for audio, which has unique spectral and temporal structures. Bridging this gap requires dual-view graph modeling suited to audio signals. In this work, we introduce SIGNL (Spectral-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a label-efficient expert system for detecting audio deepfakes. SIGNL operates on the visual representation of audio, such as spectrograms or other time-frequency encodings, transforming them into spectral and temporal graphs for structured feature extraction. It then employs graph convolutional encoders to learn complementary frequency-time features, effectively capturing the unique characteristics of audio. These encoders are pre-trained using a non-contrastive self-supervised learning strategy on augmented graph pairs, enabling effective representation learning without labeled data. The resulting encoders are then fine-tuned on minimal labelled data for downstream deepfake detection. SIGNL achieves strong performance on multiple audio deepfake detection benchmarks, including 7.88% EER on ASVspoof 2021 DF and 3.95% EER on ASVspoof 5 using only 5% labeled data. It also generalizes well to unseen conditions, reaching 10.16% EER on the In-The-Wild dataset when trained on CFAD.</p></details> |  |

While generative AI approaches have shown promise in designing novel dye scaffolds, prior efforts often produced synthetically intractable candidates due to a lack of reaction constraints. Here, we developed SyntheFluor-RL, a generative AI model that employs known reaction libraries and molecular building blocks to create readily synthesizable fluorescent molecule scaffolds via reinforcement learning. To guide the generation of fluorophores, SyntheFluor-RL employs a scoring function built on multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) that predict key photophysical properties, including photoluminescence quantum yield, absorption, and emission wavelengths. These outputs are dynamically weighted and combined with a computed pi-conjugation score to prioritize candidates with desirable optical characteristics and synthetic feasibility. SyntheFluor-RL generated 11,590 candidate molecules, which were filtered to 19 structures predicted to possess dye-like properties. Of the 19 molecules, 14 were synthesized and 13 were experimentally confirmed. The top three were characterized, with the lead compound featuring a benzothiadiazole chromophore and exhibiting strong fluorescence (PLQY = 0.62), a large Stokes shift (97 nm), and a long excited-state lifetime (11.5 ns). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SyntheFluor-RL in the identification of synthetically accessible fluorophores for further development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matching and Diffusion Models via PointNet for Generating Fluid Fields on Irregular Geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03030v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices, as is common in U-Net-based flow matching and diffusion models. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reqo: A Comprehensive Learning-Based Cost Model for Robust and Explainable Query Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17414v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although machine learning (ML) shows potential in improving query optimization by generating and selecting more efficient plans, ensuring the robustness of learning-based cost models (LCMs) remains challenging. These LCMs currently lack explainability, which undermines user trust and limits the ability to derive insights from their cost predictions to improve plan quality. Accurately converting tree-structured query plans into representations via tree models is also essential, as omitting any details may negatively impact subsequent cost model performance. Additionally, inherent uncertainty in cost estimation leads to inaccurate predictions, resulting in suboptimal plan selection. To address these challenges, we introduce Reqo, a Robust and Explainable Query Optimization cost model that comprehensively enhances three main stages in query optimization: plan generation, plan representation, and plan selection. Reqo integrates three innovations: the first explainability technique for LCMs that quantifies subgraph contributions and produces plan generation hints to enhance candidate plan quality; a novel tree model based on Bidirectional Graph Neural Networks (Bi-GNNs) with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) aggregator to further capture both node-level and structural information and effectively strengthen plan representation; and an uncertainty-aware learning-to-rank cost estimator that adaptively integrates cost estimates with uncertainties to enhance plan selection robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Reqo outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all three stages.</p></details> |  |
